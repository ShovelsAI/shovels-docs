      - **~6% of permits now have new IDs.** Attributes such as `permit_number` and address remain unchanged.

      <Warning>
        If you query by cached `id` and encounter missing results (404), use `permit_number`, address, or other metadata to re-fetch the permit. If you still encounter issues, reach out—we’ll help map old IDs to new ones.
      </Warning>
      ### ‼️ Contractor ID Updates

      - **~170,000 contractors have new IDs** that have been regenerated based on improved data quality.
      - All contractors remain searchable by:
        - Areas of work
        - Permit projects
        - Business names

      <Warning>
        If you cache contractor IDs on your end and you encounter not-found responses, use other record attributes to update IDs on your end. If ID changes affect your workflow in a more substantial way, contact us directly and we’ll assist.

        There were in total almost 3000 different classifications categories across different state files. We standardized this to the following categories:

    <Accordion title="Breaking Changes Policies">
      In order to ensure smooth transitions between updates, we've settled on a few short term policies.

      1. We will do our best to give as much advance warning on breaking changes as possible.
         - Some recent breaking changes are delayed updates to the schema that should have been part of the V2 launch. **We do not plan on making breaking changes this often.**
      2. Where sensible and possible, we will provide backward compatibility for new endpoints, parameters, and schemas.

    <Accordion title="Address Coordinate Errors">
      As described under **EDL** changes above, we found that there were rare cases where the latitude and longitude coordinates were reversed. Affected records have been corrected.
