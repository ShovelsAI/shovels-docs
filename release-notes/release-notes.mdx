      ### Introduction

      Happy New Year! We're starting 2026 with 5.5M new permits, 4.7M additional geocoded records, and 171K new contractors. On the API side, we've added negative query filters and dynamic tallies, plus performance improvements for contractor and text search. Here's everything new this month.

      ### 🚀 What's New

      ### 🏗️ Permits Dataset

      **New Permits Added**
      - **5.5M Records**
      - Expanding historical and current coverage across all jurisdictions

      - Permits filed in December 2025: **295K**

      **🧱 Permit Activity by Category**

      - **Electrical Permits:** **+1.3M** - Largest category growth this release
      - Plumbing permits: **+803K**
      - HVAC permits: **+569K**
      - New construction permits: **+460K**
      - Remodel permits: **+351K**

      - **+4.7M Records**
      - Now with latitude and longitude coordinates
      - Total geocoded permits: **143.9M**

      This release significantly improves spatial completeness for downstream mapping and location-based analysis.

      ### 👷 Contractor Intelligence

      **New Contractors Added**
      - **+171K Records**
      - Total now: **3.6M contractors** in our database
      - Additional contractor licenses captured: **+256K**

      ### Introduction

      Happy New Year! We're starting 2026 with 5.5M new permits, 4.7M additional geocoded records, and 171K new contractors. On the API side, we've added negative query filters and dynamic tallies, plus performance improvements for contractor and text search. Here's everything new this month.

      ### 🚀 What's New

      ### ⚡ API: New Features

      **Negative Query Filters**

      Exclude specific tags and classifications using a dash prefix:

      ```
      # Exclude HVAC permits
      permit_tags=-hvac

      # Mixed: solar permits excluding roofing
      permit_tags=solar&permit_tags=-roofing
      ```

      <Warning>
        **Note:** Pure negative queries at state-level are limited to 365 days. Add a positive filter or use a more specific geo_id to expand the range.
      </Warning>

      **Dynamic Tallies in Contractor Search**

      Use `include_tallies=true` to get `tag_tally` and `status_tally` per contractor. Tallies are scoped to your search filters (date range, geo, tags).

      **Clarified Contractor Search Semantics**

      Filters work independently: `permit_tags` for capability/expertise, `permit_from/to` for activity period, and `tag_tally` for work breakdown within that period.

      ### 🔧 API: Performance & Bug Fixes

      **Performance improvements**
      - Contractor search and full-text search (`permit_q`) are now significantly faster, especially for broad geo queries
      - Text search also supports English stemming, so "installing" matches "install"

      **Invalid date range handling**
      - Now returns 422 with a clear message instead of 500 Internal Server Error

      **Contractor search pagination**
      - Fixed an issue where pagination could prematurely signal end of results

      **🧠 Data Intelligence Breakthrough**

      **Property Type Classification Enhanced**
      - **20M+ Permits Reclassified**
      - **4M additional addresses** now correctly labeled as commercial or residential

      Our enhanced data pipeline now analyzes permit descriptions—the most reliable source of regulatory context—to automatically infer property types. This means more accurate market segmentation and better targeting capabilities for your use cases.

      ### 🚀 What's New

      **🔌 API Improvements**

      **New Contractor Classification Parameter**
      - `contractor_classification_derived` - Human-readable categories with nationwide coverage

      We've introduced a new query parameter that replaces state-specific license codes with standardized, human-readable categories like "electrical", "hvac", and "plumbing". This works consistently across all states, making it easier to filter and discover contractors without domain expertise.

      ### ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

      <Warning>
        **Legacy `contractor_classifications` parameter status:** **Deprecated**
        
        The old parameter continues to work for backward compatibility, but we recommend migrating to the new standardized taxonomy for better user experience and broader coverage.

      ### Introduction

      This month marks a pivotal moment in our mission: we've begun bridging the gap between online and offline permit data. For the first time, we're bringing dark data into the light, accessing jurisdictions that have never made their records digitally available. Combined with significant growth across our platform, October's release represents our most comprehensive coverage to date.

      ### 🚀 What's New

      **Bridging the Digital Divide: Offline Jurisdictions Brought Online**
      - **500K+ Records**
      - First-ever offline permit acquisition from **Cook County, IL** and **Oak Ridge North, TX**

      Many jurisdictions still operate without public-facing digital portals. We're now bringing this offline data online, giving you comprehensive coverage without the manual work. This is just the beginning of connecting America's fragmented permit landscape into one unified, accessible platform.

      ### 📊 Data Growth

      **Total Records**
      - **185M** (+10M new permit records added - historical and newly filed)
      - **Permits filed in September:** 80K
      - **Permits filed in 2025 year-to-date:** 4.5M

      This month marks a pivotal moment in our mission: we've begun bridging the gap between online and offline permit data. For the first time, we're bringing dark data into the light, accessing jurisdictions that have never made their records digitally available. Combined with significant growth across our platform, October's release represents our most comprehensive coverage to date.

      ### 🚀 What's New

      **Bridging the Digital Divide: Offline Jurisdictions Brought Online**
      - **500K+ Records**
      - First-ever offline permit acquisition from **Cook County, IL** and **Oak Ridge North, TX**

      Many jurisdictions still operate without public-facing digital portals. We're now bringing this offline data online, giving you comprehensive coverage without the manual work. This is just the beginning of connecting America's fragmented permit landscape into one unified, accessible platform.

      ### 📊 Data Growth

      **Total Records**
      - **185M** (+10M new permit records added - historical and newly filed)
      - **Permits filed in September:** 80K
      - **Permits filed in 2025 year-to-date:** 4.5M

      ### 👷 Contractor Intelligence

      **New contractors added to our database**
      - **190K contractors** - Expanding your universe of potential partners and competitors
      - **New license records:** 70K
      - **New contractor phone numbers:** 200K+

      - **~6% of permits now have new IDs.** Attributes such as `permit_number` and address remain unchanged.

      <Warning>
        If you query by cached `id` and encounter missing results (404), use `permit_number`, address, or other metadata to re-fetch the permit. If you still encounter issues, reach out—we’ll help map old IDs to new ones.
      </Warning>
      ### ‼️ Contractor ID Updates

      - **~170,000 contractors have new IDs** that have been regenerated based on improved data quality.
      - All contractors remain searchable by:
        - Areas of work
        - Permit projects
        - Business names

      <Warning>
        If you cache contractor IDs on your end and you encounter not-found responses, use other record attributes to update IDs on your end. If ID changes affect your workflow in a more substantial way, contact us directly and we’ll assist.

      1. We will do our best to give as much advance warning on breaking changes as possible.
         - Some recent breaking changes are delayed updates to the schema that should have been part of the V2 launch. **We do not plan on making breaking changes this often.**

      ### 💥 Breaking:

      - `contractors` table:
        - `first_seen_at` **renamed** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> `first_seen_date`.
          - Data type **changed** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> `DATE`.
        - `reviews` **renamed** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> `review_count`.
      - `residents` table:
        - Foreign key **changed** from `permit_id` <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> `address_id`.

      <Warning>
        Please ensure that any existing queries or automation using `first_seen_at`, `reviews`, or `permit_id` are updated accordingly.
