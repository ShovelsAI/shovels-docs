Welcome to the Shovels Data Dictionary!

This section of our documentation is a reference guide to all the data within the platform, including field names, data types, descriptions, examples, and more. 

There will be an overarching table for core concepts and objects, and then sub-pages with tables specific to each product within the platform. 

Generally speaking, the data hierarchy is as follows:

1. Shovels Online
2. Shovels API (includes all objects available in **Online**, with some extras)
3. Shovels EDL (includes all objects, fields, and data available in the entire platform)
