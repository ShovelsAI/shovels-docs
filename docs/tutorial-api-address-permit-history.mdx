When using the Shovels API, it's important to know how to chain together information from different endpoints to get the data you need. 

In this tutorial, we'll be looking at the multi-step process of retrieving permit history for a given address. 

Let's get into it.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Authenticate" titleSize="h3" stepNumber={0}>
        Authenticate with the Shovels API using your API key. For more information on getting started with the Shovels API, please see our [API Introduction > Authentication](/docs/shovels-api-introduction#authentication).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Find the Address" titleSize="h3" stepNumber={1}>
        Use the `GET /v2/addresses/search` endpoint, and enter the address string. 

        In this example, we'll use cURL to make the request, and look for the address "123 Main St".

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/addresses/search?address=123%20Main%20St" \
            -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```

        This will return a list of addresses that match the search string. Pick the one that matches the address you're looking for originally (you may need to paginate to see the full results).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Retrieve the Address's GEO_ID" titleSize="h3" stepNumber={2}>
        From the response body in **Step 1**, note or otherwise extract the `geo_id` of the address. It should look like a alphanumeric string. 

        <Note>
            The `geo_id` is the unique identifier for all location objects in the Shovels platform. These don't only correspond to individual addresses or property plots, but also exist for other geographical segments like `cities`, `counties`, `jurisdictions`, and `states`. 
        </Note>

        This `geo_id` will be what you need for **Step 3**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Retrieve Permit History" titleSize="h3" stepNumber={3}>
        Use the `GET /v2/permits/search` endpoint, and enter the `geo_id` you extracted in **Step 2**.

        You will also need to specify the `permit_from` and `permit_to` strings, which are required fields. These represent the time bounds to search for permits for the given address. 

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/permits/search?geo_id=$GEO_ID&permit_from=YYYY-MM-DD&permit_to=YYYY-MM-DD' \
            -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```

        This will return all permits for the given address within the date range you specified. 
    </Step>

    <Step title="Do it again (Optional)" titleSize="h3" stepNumber={4}>
        Now you have your permit history, and you can repeat this for any other addresses you need data for. 
    </Step>
</Steps>
