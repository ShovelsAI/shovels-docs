Yes, Shovels captures permits that don't have an associated address. This is a common occurrence for certain types of construction projects.

## Why Permits Lack Addresses

Address IDs are only assigned if physical addresses can be confirmed via internal and third-party databases.

Common reasons for missing addresses:

### New Construction

Permits for new construction are often submitted before official addresses exist or streets are named. Construction needs to begin before an official address is assigned by the post office.

### Newly Subdivided Parcels

When land is subdivided, permits may be pulled before addresses are created for the new lots.

### Undeveloped Land

Projects on undeveloped land where no street address has been established.

## What's Included Without Addresses

For permits without addresses, Shovels still provides:
- Unique permit ID
- State information
- Jurisdiction information

What's **not** included:
- Address ID
- Physical address
- Geographic identifiers (county, city codes)

## Value of Address-less Permits

These permits are valuable because they often represent:
- New construction projects at their earliest stages
- Early intelligence about upcoming construction activity
- Development opportunities

<Tip>
For users interested in new development opportunities, permits without addresses can provide early signals about upcoming construction.

## Address Assignment Over Time

As projects progress and official addresses are assigned:
1. The jurisdiction updates their records
2. We capture the new address information
3. Records are linked, allowing continuous tracking throughout the construction lifecycle
