description: "Learn the difference between Shovels' unique permit ID and the jurisdiction-assigned permit number, and why using the correct identifier matters."
---

Each permit in Shovels has a unique identifier that distinguishes it from all other permits in our database.

## Shovels ID vs Permit Number

| Field | Description | Uniqueness |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **ID** | Generated by Shovels | Globally unique across all permits |
| **permit_no** | Assigned by the jurisdiction | Only unique within that jurisdiction |

## Why This Matters

Different jurisdictions may coincidentally assign the same `permit_no` to different permits. For example:
- Los Angeles might issue permit #12345
- San Francisco might also issue permit #12345

These are completely different permits, but they share the same permit number.

<Warning>
Always use the Shovels `ID` field to organize data by unique permit identifiers, not `permit_no`.
</Warning>

## Using Shovels IDs

The Shovels ID:
- Remains persistent throughout the permit lifecycle
- Never duplicates across jurisdictions
- Enables reliable data joins and tracking
- Stays consistent across data refreshes
