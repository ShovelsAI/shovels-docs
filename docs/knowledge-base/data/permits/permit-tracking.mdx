Shovels uses a robust system of unique IDs to track multiple permits at a single property.

## How Our ID System Works

### Permit IDs

Each permit receives a **unique permit ID** that remains consistent throughout its lifecycle—from application to completion.

### Address IDs

Each address gets a **unique address ID** the first time it appears in our system. This allows you to easily connect all permits associated with that location.

### Contractor IDs

Each contractor receives a **unique contractor ID** when they first appear on any permit.

## Connecting Related Data

These IDs act as reference points (foreign keys) that enable you to:
- Track all permits at a specific property
- Find all permits by a specific contractor
- Join related permits, addresses, and contractors in analysis

<Tip>
Use the address ID to find all permits associated with a specific property, even if the address is written differently across different permits.
</Tip>

## Use Cases

This system is particularly valuable for:
- **Tracking property improvements over time**
- **Identifying contractors who frequently work at the same location**
- **Analyzing permitting patterns for specific properties**
- **Building relationships between different data points**

## ID Persistence

Our IDs are designed to be stable:
- Permit IDs remain the same as status changes
- Address IDs persist even with formatting variations
- Contractor IDs stay consistent across all their permits

<Info>
The Shovels ID is distinct from the `permit_no` (permit number) assigned by the jurisdiction. Different jurisdictions may coincidentally assign the same permit number, so always use the Shovels ID for unique identification.
