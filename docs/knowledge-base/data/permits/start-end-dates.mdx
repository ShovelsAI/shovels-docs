description: "Learn how Shovels defines start_date and end_date fields for permits and how they help you understand permit timelines."
---

The start date and end date fields in Shovels data help you understand the timeline of each permit.

## Definitions

| Field | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **start_date** | The first date recorded for a permit |
| **end_date** | The last date recorded for a permit |

These date fields are **generated by Shovels** based on the permit data we collect from jurisdictions.

## How They're Used

Start and end dates help you:
- Calculate total permit duration
- Understand project timelines
- Compare permit processing across jurisdictions
- Identify stalled or delayed projects

## Other Important Date Fields

Shovels also tracks specific milestone dates:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `file_date` | When the permit application was filed |
| `issue_date` | When the permit was approved/issued |
| `final_date` | When the project passed final inspection |
