To determine whether a project was completed and passed inspection, check the permit status.

## Checking Completion Status

A permit with status **"final"** indicates:
- All work has been completed
- The project has passed inspection
- The permit lifecycle is complete

```
status: "final"
final_date: "2024-06-15"
```

## What the Status Tells You

| Status | Project State |
|--------|--------------|
| `in_review` | Application submitted, not yet approved |
| `active` | Approved, work may be in progress |
| `final` | Completed and passed inspection |
| `inactive` | Stalled, expired, or abandoned |

## Additional Information

Permit records can provide various details about projects, but availability depends on what the jurisdiction includes:
- **System size** - Depends on permit description detail
- **Inspection results** - Reflected in status changes
- **Timeline** - Captured in date fields

<Info>
Historical permit records can be accessed, with some jurisdictions providing data going back 25+ years.
