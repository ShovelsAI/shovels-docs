**Shovels uses four permit statuses: `in_review` (filed, awaiting approval), `active` (approved, work can proceed), `final` (completed, passed inspection), and `inactive` (stalled, expired, or abandoned).** These statuses track a permit's progression through its lifecycle.

## Permit Statuses in Shovels

There are **four** primary statuses that permits can have:

### in_review

From the moment the permit is filed with the local jurisdiction until it is approved.

- **Defined by:** `file_date`
- **Meaning:** Permit application is being reviewed

### active

From the moment the permit is approved until project completion or some other intermediate restriction.

- **Defined by:** `issue_date`
- **Meaning:** Permit has been approved, work can proceed

### final

When the permit is completed and submitted back to the jurisdiction upon job completion.

- **Defined by:** `final_date`
- **Meaning:** Project is complete, passed final inspection

### inactive

If any part of the process stalls or gets restricted from progression.

**Reasons a permit may become inactive:**
- Failing to meet project inspections
- Permit expires before completion
- [Inactivity for more than 6 months (180 days)](https://ecode360.com/6567722#6567722)
- Other jurisdiction-specific reasons

<Info>
Disqualifying reasons and reporting timeframes vary by jurisdiction and local regulation.

## Special Cases

### "Unknown" and "None" Statuses

Sometimes permits have "unknown" or "none" statuses. This can happen due to:
- Variances in jurisdiction record keeping
- Lack of data
- Dates not provided by the jurisdiction

The exact meanings may vary depending on the context or jurisdiction.

### Final Status Without Final Date

If a permit has a final status but no final date, it typically indicates an **over-the-counter permit**—one that was approved immediately without needing a follow-up inspection.

Common over-the-counter permits include:
- Solar installations
- Simple plumbing work
- Minor electrical work

<Note>
This can vary by city and county—some jurisdictions process more permit types over-the-counter than others.
