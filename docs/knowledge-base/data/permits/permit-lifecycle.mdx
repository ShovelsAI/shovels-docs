title: "How Permits Are Tracked Through Their Lifecycle"
description: "Understand how Shovels tracks individual permits from filing to completion using unique IDs and status updates without creating duplicates."

Each permit in the Shovels database receives a unique permit ID that remains persistent throughout its entire lifecycle.

## How It Works

As updates are made to a permit—such as status changes, valuation adjustments, or contractor assignments—we update the data while maintaining the same permit ID.

This approach ensures:
- A continuous record of the permit's progression
- No duplicate entries from status updates
- Reliable tracking across data refreshes

## Permit Lifecycle Stages

The permit lifecycle typically flows through several stages:

| Stage | Status | Date Field |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Filing | `in_review` | `file_date` |
| Approval | `active` | `issued_date` |
| Completion | `final` | `final_date` |
| Abandoned/Revoked | `inactive` | - |

## Status Updates

For each status change, we update the corresponding date fields while maintaining the same unique identifier. This allows users to track a permit's complete history without piecing together fragments across multiple records.

## Deduplication

Our deduplication process ensures that even when jurisdictions report the same permit multiple times with different statuses, Shovels presents a single, up-to-date record with the most current information.

<Info>
If a permit has a final status but no final date, it typically indicates an **over-the-counter permit**—one that was approved immediately without the need for a follow-up inspection.
