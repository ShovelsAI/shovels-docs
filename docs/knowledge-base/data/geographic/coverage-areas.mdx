## Data Sources

We gather permit data from a variety of sources:

### Primary Sources
- **Local jurisdiction websites** - City and county building department online portals
- **Municipal open data portals** - Dedicated open data initiatives
- **Building department APIs** - Official jurisdiction APIs when available
- **Public records requests** - For jurisdictions without digital access

### Supplementary Sources
- **State contractor licensing boards** - To verify contractor information
- **Address standardization databases** - Multiple sources for geocoding and standardization
- **Tax assessor records** - To enhance property information

## Historical Data

Our data coverage extends back to **at least 2010** for all jurisdictions, with many going further back.

<Info>
In some cases, jurisdictions don't pull historical data into their online systems, which can limit how far back certain records go.
</Info>

## Why Some Permits Might Be Missing

Even in covered jurisdictions, some permits may not appear due to:
- **Digitization gaps** - Not all jurisdictions have digitized historical records
- **Data availability** - Some permits lack required fields or are incomplete
- **Processing delays** - New permits take time to enter our system

For a detailed explanation, see [Permit Availability](/docs/foundations-understanding-permits) in our Foundations section.
