**A jurisdiction is the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)—the governmental body responsible for issuing building permits in a specific area, typically a city or county government.** The United States has approximately 20,000 jurisdictions. Shovels covers about 2,000 of them, representing ~85% of the US population.

## What is an AHJ?

An AHJ is typically either:
- A **county government**
- A **city government**

## Why Jurisdictions Matter

Jurisdictions play a crucial role in the construction permitting process:
- **Establish and enforce building codes**
- **Conduct inspections**
- **Maintain official records** of construction activities

Understanding which jurisdiction governs a particular property is essential for contractors and service providers, as it determines:
- Which rules apply
- Which office must approve permits
- Specific requirements and processes
