The latitude and longitude coordinates in Shovels' data are derived from our proprietary geocoding process.

## How It Works

Rather than relying on a single third-party service, we perform geocoding ourselves using multiple reference sources to ensure accuracy.

## Data Sources

Our process cross-references addresses against several authoritative datasets:
- **National Address Dataset** from the US Census
- **Open Address dataset**
- **Simple Maps**
- **ESRI**

This multi-source approach allows us to achieve higher accuracy rates than depending on any single geocoding service.

## Why Accurate Geocoding Matters

Accurate geocoding is particularly important in the construction industry, where precise location information can impact:
- Permit jurisdiction determination
- Zoning requirements
- Service area analysis
- Market visualization

## What You Can Do With Coordinates

Our coordinates enable customers to:
- Perform spatial analysis
- Create map visualizations
- Calculate distances
- Identify geographic patterns in construction activity

## Part of Address Standardization

The geocoding process is part of our broader address standardization pipeline, which ensures:
- Consistent formatting across the database
- Accurate location data regardless of original permit formatting
- Reliable geographic identification

Address geocoding is done in-house at Shovels to ensure accuracy and consistency across our entire database.
