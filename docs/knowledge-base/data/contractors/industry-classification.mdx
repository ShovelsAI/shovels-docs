description: "Understand NAICS and SIC industry classification codes in Shovels contractor data, their sources, and limitations."
---

Shovels includes industry classification data for contractors, though this data has important limitations to understand.

## Available Classification Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **NAICS** | North American Industry Classification System codes |
| **SIC** | Standard Industrial Classification codes |
| **Primary_industry** | General industry classification |

## Data Sources

Business industry classifications come from self-reported data, typically through:
- Business registration
- Insurance-related transactions

## Important Limitations

### Self-Reported Nature

Classifications are self-reported by businesses, not verified by Shovels.

### Broad Categories

Classifications are quite broad and may not precisely reflect a contractor's specialization.

### Multiple Classifications

Companies in higher-risk occupations often use multiple industry identifiers to reduce their workers' compensation insurance liability.

### No Central Authority

There is no central authority governing these categories.

<Warning>
The Primary_industry field should be taken with a grain of salt due to these limitations.
</Warning>

## NAICS vs SIC

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **NAICS** | More modern and specific classification system |
| **SIC** | Older system, but more widely adopted |

Both are included in our data because NAICS isn't as widely adopted as SIC codes.

## Better Alternatives

For understanding what a contractor actually does, consider:
- **Permit descriptions** - What work they've actually permitted
- **Tags** - Shovels-assigned categories based on permit data
- **Permit history** - Patterns of work they've completed
