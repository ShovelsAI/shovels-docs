Shovels provides comprehensive contractor data derived directly from permit records.

## Data Sources

Contractor information comes from:
- Permit application data
- State contractor licensing boards
- Business registration records

## Regional Coverage Variations

Contractor data coverage varies by region based on what jurisdictions include on permits.

### Strong Coverage Areas

- West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington)
- New York (metro area)
- Certain areas of the Midwest

### Coverage Challenges

**Upstate New York** - Coverage is not as comprehensive as the metro area.

**Massachusetts** - The township structure means permit data and contractor details aren't always readily available online.

**New Jersey** - The state doesn't typically include contractor data on permits.

These regional variations reflect different reporting requirements and data availability across jurisdictions.
