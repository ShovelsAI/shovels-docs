Shovels provides comprehensive contact information for contractors when available.

## Address Information

We provide complete USPS-standardized addresses including:
- Street address
- City
- State
- ZIP code
- Unit or suite numbers (when available)

Our addresses undergo rigorous verification against multiple sources:
- National Address Dataset (US Census)
- Open Address dataset
- Simple Maps
- ESRI

<Tip>
The standardized format makes it easy to integrate with mapping services, CRM systems, or marketing platforms.

## Phone Numbers

### primary_phone vs phone

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **primary_phone** | The most frequently used phone number across all permits for this contractor |
| **phone** | A comma-separated list of all phone numbers encountered, ordered by frequency |

**Example:** If a contractor used three different phone numbers across their permit history (one on 70% of permits, others on 15% each), the most common number is designated as `primary_phone`, while all three appear in `phone`.

## Contact Names and Emails

### Why They May Not Match

Contact names and email addresses don't always align because they're captured differently:

- **Contact names** are specific to individual permits (the name on that permit application)
- **primary_email** is determined by analyzing frequency across all permits for a contractor

**Example:** If John Smith is listed on a specific permit, but jane.doe@company.com appears most frequently across all that contractor's permits, `primary_email` shows Jane's email.

<Info>
This approach ensures you have the most actively used contact point, which increases the likelihood of successful communication.
