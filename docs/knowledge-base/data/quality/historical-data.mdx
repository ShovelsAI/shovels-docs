Shovels' data coverage extends back to provide substantial historical context for analysis.

## Coverage Timeframe

Our data extends back to **at least 2010** for all jurisdictions, with many jurisdictions offering data that goes even further back.

## Why 2010?

This timeframe was a technical architecture decision based on:
- Majority of customer feedback
- Common use cases requiring ~10-15 years of history
- Data availability from jurisdictions

## Limitations

In some cases, jurisdictions don't pull historical data into their online systems, which can limit how far back certain records go.

<Info>
Our coverage of the past decade-plus provides sufficient historical context for most analysis needs, including tracking long-term trends and contractor history.
