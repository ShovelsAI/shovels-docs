Shovels verifies data accuracy through multiple external sources to ensure reliability.

## Address Verification

For address standardization, we cross-reference details using **four different address sources**:
- National Address Dataset from the US Census
- Open Address dataset
- Simple Maps
- ESRI

This multi-source approach ensures:
- Consistent formatting
- Accurate geocoding
- Reliable location identification

## Contractor Verification

We match contractor information against:
- **Publicly available state license files**
- **Business registration records**

This ensures contractors in our database are:
- Properly licensed
- Legitimate operators in their respective fields

## Data Labeling Process

For permit classification, we employ a rigorous annotation process:
- Multiple independent annotators label each record
- Manual review resolves divergent responses
- Validation sample size is 1-5% of overall data

<Info>
Our approach has achieved **98% accuracy** in classifications, validated by construction industry experts.

## Golden Dataset Methodology

Annotators independently solve tasks rather than validating model outputs. This:
- Prevents annotator bias
- Creates a "golden dataset" of correct answers
- Enables benchmarking of new model outputs without fresh validation
