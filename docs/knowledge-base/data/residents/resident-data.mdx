Shovels provides resident data features including demographic information compiled from multiple sources.

## Available Data Features

### Additional Consumer Attributes
- Number of kids

## Data Sources

Shovels' resident data comes from multiple non-LinkedIn sources. We assemble data about individuals via common linkages between:
- Person's name
- Workplace
- Personal address
- Business or personal contact information

## Data Compilation Process

Our process uses **consensus and observation date methodology** to select the most likely and current data points for each individual.

### Consensus Validation
We require 3+ different data signals to confirm data linkages, with reliability ensured through exhaustive validation methods and confirmation from actual usage.

### Conformation
This process ensures data within the "Consensus" realm not only represents frequent occurrences but also adheres to proper formatting and data standards.

<Info>
The data includes both directly observed information and modeled/probabilistic data.

## Accessing Resident Data

### Via API

To access resident contact information, pass the `address_id` from a permit object into the [residents endpoint](/api-reference/addresses/get-residents):

```bash
GET /v2/addresses/{address_id}/residents
```

This returns contact info like name, phone, and email for occupants associated with the address.

### Via EDL

EDL customers have access to:
- `PERSONAL_EMAILS` - Personal email addresses
- `BUSINESS_EMAIL` - Business email addresses
- `HOMEOWNER` field - Filter for `HOMEOWNER = Y`

## Using Demographics for Homeowner Analysis

You can use available features like:
- Income range
- Children present
- Net worth

To identify trends that could help determine homeownership likelihood at certain demographic levels.
