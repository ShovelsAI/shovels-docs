The probabilistic homeowner feature in Shovels' residents data indicates whether a person is likely the property owner.

## Data Source

The homeowner data is sourced from our data co-op members and represents a **consensus-driven determination** of property ownership.

## Validation Methods

### Consensus

We require **3+ different data signals** to confirm data linkages, with reliability ensured through:
- Exhaustive validation methods
- Confirmation from actual usage
- Multiple data point verification

For example, the presence of a unit number is considered as part of this compilation.

### Conformation

This process ensures that data within the "Consensus" realm:
- Represents frequent occurrences
- Adheres to proper formatting and data standards
- Cannot be invalidated using existing signals

## Using the Homeowner Field

### In EDL Data

Filter for homeowners using:
```
HOMEOWNER = 'Y'
```

### Combined with Other Features

You can use additional features to identify homeownership patterns:
- Income range
- Children present
- Net worth

<Tip>
Combining the homeowner field with demographic indicators helps identify trends at certain demographic levels.

## Consumer Attributes Dataset

We also offer additional features in our "Consumer Attributes" dataset including:
- Number of kids
- Grandparent in household
- Other household composition data
