Shovels Decisions are categorized by the type of municipal action they represent. Understanding these categories helps you filter for the decisions most relevant to your use case.

## Primary Categories

### Spot Rezoning

A zoning change applied to a specific property or small group of parcels. Spot rezonings are typically initiated by property owners or developers seeking to change what can be built on their land.

**Examples:**
- Changing a single-family residential lot to allow multifamily development
- Converting a commercial parcel to mixed-use
- Rezoning an industrial site for residential development

**Why it matters:** Spot rezonings often signal imminent development activity on that specific property.

### Area Rezoning

A zoning change applied to a larger geographic area, often initiated by the municipality as part of a comprehensive planning effort.

**Examples:**
- Rezoning an entire corridor for transit-oriented development
- Upzoning a neighborhood to allow higher density
- Creating a new overlay district for a downtown area

**Why it matters:** Area rezonings indicate broader market shifts and can affect property values across many parcels.

### Zoning Code Modification

Changes to the zoning regulations themselves, rather than the zoning designation of specific properties. These modify what's allowed within existing zones.

**Examples:**
- Adjusting height limits in commercial zones
- Adding accessory dwelling units (ADUs) as a permitted use
- Modifying parking requirements citywide

**Why it matters:** Code modifications can unlock development potential across all properties in affected zones without individual rezonings.

### Special Use Permit

Permission to conduct a specific activity that isn't automatically allowed in a zone but may be approved with conditions. Also called conditional use permits in some jurisdictions.

**Examples:**
- Operating a restaurant with outdoor seating in a residential area
- Building a cell tower in a commercial zone
- Running a daycare facility in a mixed-use building

**Why it matters:** Special use permits often precede specific business or development activity at a known location.

## Subcategories

Decisions may also include subcategories that provide additional context:

| Subcategory | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Inclusionary Zoning** | Requirements or incentives for affordable housing units |
| **Conditional Use** | Approval contingent on meeting specific conditions |
| **Planned Unit Development (PUD)** | Flexible zoning for master-planned projects |
| **Variance** | Exception to specific zoning requirements |
| **Historic Overlay** | Special regulations for historic preservation |

## Filtering by Category

When searching for decisions, you can filter by category to focus on the types most relevant to your needs:

- **Development tracking:** Focus on Spot Rezoning and Special Use Permits
- **Market analysis:** Include Area Rezoning and Zoning Code Modifications
- **Comprehensive monitoring:** Include all categories

Category names may vary slightly by jurisdiction. Shovels normalizes these into consistent categories while preserving the original terminology in the decision details.
