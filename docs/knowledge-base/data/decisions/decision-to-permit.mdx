Shovels is the only platform that connects municipal decisions to permit data, giving you visibility into the complete development lifecycle. This article explains how these data types work together.

## The Development Timeline

A typical development project moves through several stages before construction begins:

```
City Council Discussion → Zoning Approval → Permit Application → Permit Issued → Construction → Certificate of Occupancy
        ↑                       ↑                    ↑                                              ↑
    DECISIONS               DECISIONS             PERMITS                                       PERMITS
```

### Stage 1: Proposal and Discussion

Development projects often first appear in city council agendas or planning commission meetings. At this stage, the project is being discussed but no formal action has been taken.

**What you see in Decisions:** Meeting agenda items, preliminary discussions, public hearing notices.

### Stage 2: Zoning Approval

If the project requires a zoning change, special use permit, or variance, it must be approved by the relevant municipal body. This is the core of what Shovels Decisions captures.

**What you see in Decisions:** Approved rezonings, conditional use permits, variances, and zoning code modifications.

### Stage 3: Permit Application and Issuance

After zoning is in place, the developer applies for building permits. This is where Shovels permit data begins tracking the project.

**What you see in Permits:** Filed applications, permit approvals, contractor assignments, inspection schedules.

### Stage 4: Construction and Completion

As construction proceeds, permits are updated with status changes, inspections, and eventually final approval.

**What you see in Permits:** Status updates, final inspections, certificates of occupancy.

## Time Advantage

The gap between a zoning decision and permit filing varies by project complexity:

| Project Type | Typical Gap |
|--------------|-------------|
| Minor commercial renovation | 2-4 weeks |
| New single-family home | 1-3 months |
| Multifamily development | 3-6 months |
| Large commercial project | 6-12 months |

By monitoring decisions, you gain visibility into projects during this gap—before they appear in permit data.

## Connecting Decisions to Permits

Several fields help you link decisions to eventual permits:

### Geographic Matching

- **Address:** The property address in a decision should match the permit address
- **Coordinates:** Latitude/longitude enable spatial matching when addresses differ slightly
- **Geo IDs:** Standardized geographic identifiers allow precise joins

### Entity Matching

- **Applicant/Owner:** The decision applicant often appears as the permit applicant or property owner
- **Developer:** Development company names may appear in both records
- **Contractor:** Contractors assigned to permits may be associated with the developer from the decision

### Timeline Correlation

Permits filed within the expected window after a relevant decision at the same location are likely related to that project.

## Use Cases

### Early Lead Generation

Identify projects at the decision stage to reach potential customers before competitors who only monitor permits.

**Example:** A roofing contractor monitors area rezonings for multifamily developments, then contacts developers months before permit applications are filed.

### Site Selection Intelligence

Track zoning decisions to understand where development is being approved and what types of projects municipalities are favoring.

**Example:** A data center operator monitors zoning code modifications related to power infrastructure and industrial uses to identify favorable jurisdictions.

### Competitive Analysis

Monitor decisions involving specific developers or property owners to track their pipeline of upcoming projects.

**Example:** A subcontractor tracks decisions listing their target general contractors as applicants to anticipate bidding opportunities.

### Market Timing

Area rezonings and code modifications signal shifts in what can be built, affecting property values before any construction begins.

**Example:** An investor monitors upzoning decisions to identify neighborhoods where development potential—and land values—are increasing.
