---

Property types and details in Shovels data are categorized using external data sources.

## Data Source

Property type information is derived from **tax assessor files**, which are included in EDL data deliveries.

## Coverage

There may be gaps in property type coverage because:
- Not all jurisdictions have comprehensive tax assessor data
- Some properties may not have type classifications
- Newer developments may not yet be in assessor records

<Info>
We are continuously working to improve property type data coverage and accuracy.
</Info>

## Available Classifications

Common property type classifications include:
- Residential (single-family, multi-family)
- Commercial
- Industrial
- Mixed-use

## Using Property Types

### In the API

### In EDL

Property type fields are included in data deliveries with associated tax assessor information.
