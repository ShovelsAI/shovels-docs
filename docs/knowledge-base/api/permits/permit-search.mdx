To search for permits in the Shovels API, you'll use the `geo_id` parameter as the unique identifier linking addresses to their permit data.

## Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Get the Address's geo_id

Use the [Search Addresses](/api-reference/addresses/search-addresses) endpoint with your target address:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/addresses/search?street=123+Main+St&city=San+Francisco&state=CA" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

This returns the address's `geo_id`—a unique identifier you'll need for the next step.

### Step 2: Search Permits Using the geo_id

Use the [Search Permits](/api-reference/permits/search-permits) endpoint with the `geo_id` and your desired date range:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/permits/search?geo_id=ADDRESS_GEO_ID&permit_from=2020-01-01&permit_to=2024-12-31" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

<Tip>
The `geo_id` parameter is a unified geography filter. The same permit search works whether you pass a state abbreviation (`CA`), a zip code (`94103`), or an individual address's geo_id. You're just swapping out the geography level.
</Tip>

## Available Filters

The permit search endpoint supports additional filters:
- **Date ranges** (`permit_from`, `permit_to`)
- **Permit types** and subtypes
- **Property types** (residential, commercial)
- **Contractor information**
- **Tags** for specific permit categories

## Alternative: Shovels Online

For quick lookups without code, use the **Location Search** feature in [Shovels Online](https://app.shovels.ai) to search by address directly.

## Best Practices

1. Always resolve addresses first to get accurate geo_ids
2. Use date ranges to limit result sets
3. Apply filters to get exactly the permits you need
4. Handle pagination for large result sets
