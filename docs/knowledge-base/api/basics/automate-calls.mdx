Yes, developers can automate API calls by integrating the Shovels API into their applications.

## Getting Started

The API can be integrated using any programming language that supports HTTP requests. Common choices include:
- Python
- JavaScript/Node.js
- Java
- Go
- Ruby
- PHP

## Example: Python Integration

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
BASE_URL = "https://api.shovels.ai/v2"

headers = {
    "X-API-Key": API_KEY
}

# Search for permits
response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/permits/search",
    headers=headers,
    params={
        "geo_id": "CA",
        "permit_from": "2024-01-01",
        "size": 100
    }
)

data = response.json()
print(f"Found {len(data['items'])} permits")
```

## Code Snippets in Documentation

Our [API documentation](/api-reference) provides code snippets in multiple languages for each endpoint, making it easy to generate integration code for your preferred language.

## Best Practices for Automation

1. **Handle rate limits** - Implement backoff when approaching limits
2. **Use pagination** - Process large result sets in batches
3. **Cache results** - Store data locally to minimize API calls
4. **Error handling** - Handle both errors and empty results gracefully
5. **Respect the API** - Avoid frivolous or unnecessary requests

<Tip>
Check your API usage in Profile Settings to monitor your request consumption.
