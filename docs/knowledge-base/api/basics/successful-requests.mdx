A successful API request returns a **200 status code** along with the requested data.

## Success Response

When your request succeeds, you'll receive:
- HTTP status code: `200 OK`
- Response body with your requested data

```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "next_cursor": "...",
  "total": 150
}
```

## Error Responses

If there are issues, you'll receive an error code indicating the problem:

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| 200 | Success (may have empty results) |
| 400 | Bad request - check your parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - check your API key |
| 422 | Unprocessable - missing required parameter |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Server error - try again later |

## Empty Results vs Errors

<Warning>
A 200 response with an empty `items` array is **not an error**. It means:
- The address or geo_id is valid
- No permits match your query criteria
</Warning>

This commonly happens when:
- The address has no permits in our system
- Your date filters exclude all results
- The geo_id format is valid but doesn't match any records

## Troubleshooting

1. **Check your API key** - Ensure it's correctly included in the header
2. **Verify required parameters** - Most endpoints require a geo_id
3. **Review date formats** - Use YYYY-MM-DD format
4. **Check the response body** - Error messages describe what's wrong
