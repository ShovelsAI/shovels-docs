**Every HTTP call to the Shovels API counts as exactly 1 request, regardless of which endpoint you use or how many records it returns.** You can retrieve up to 100 records per call by setting `size=100`, making each request highly efficient.

## Request Counting

This applies to:
- Search endpoints (`GET /v2/permits/search`, `GET /v2/contractors/search`)
- Detail endpoints (`GET /v2/permits`, `GET /v2/contractors`)

## Records Per Request

You can retrieve up to **100 permits or contractors** in a single call by setting the `size` (or `limit`) parameter to 100. Whether you retrieve 1 record or 100, it counts as only **one request** against your quota.

## Detail Already Included

Search responses contain the full detail payload for every record returned, so you usually don't need a separate detail call. If you do call a detail endpoint—whether for one ID or many IDs—it still counts as only one request.

## Practical Examples

| Request | Count |
|---------|-------|
| `GET /v2/permits/search?size=100` | 1 request |
| `GET /v2/permits?id=123` | 1 request |
| `GET /v2/contractors/search?size=100` | 1 request |
| `GET /v2/contractors?id=abc,def,ghi` | 1 request |

Each of these consumes exactly one of your requests.

The same request usage applies whether you're on the free trial or a paid plan.

## Maximizing Your Quota

1. **Use max page size** - Set `size=100` to get the most records per request
2. **Use search endpoints** - They include full details in the response
3. **Batch detail lookups** - Pass multiple IDs in a single detail request
