**The Shovels API uses a record-based quota system.** Each record returned by an API call counts against your quota. A permit search that returns 100 results uses 100 quota, while a detail lookup for a single permit uses 1 quota.

## How Quota is Counted

Your quota is based on **records returned**, not the number of API calls you make:

- A search returning **100 permits** = **100 quota used**
- A search returning **50 contractors** = **50 quota used**
- A detail lookup for **1 permit** = **1 quota used**
- A detail lookup for **3 contractors** = **3 quota used**

This applies to all endpoints:
- Search endpoints (`GET /v2/permits/search`, `GET /v2/contractors/search`)
- Detail endpoints (`GET /v2/permits`, `GET /v2/contractors`)

## Practical Examples

| Request | Records Returned | Quota Used |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| `GET /v2/permits/search?size=100` | 100 permits | 100 |
| `GET /v2/permits/search?size=100` | 47 permits | 47 |
| `GET /v2/permits?id=123` | 1 permit | 1 |
| `GET /v2/contractors/search?size=50` | 50 contractors | 50 |
| `GET /v2/contractors?id=abc,def,ghi` | 3 contractors | 3 |

<Info>
The same quota system applies whether you're on the free trial or a paid plan.

## Managing Your Quota

1. **Use filters effectively** - Narrow your searches to return only the records you need
2. **Use search endpoints** - They include full details in the response, avoiding extra lookups
3. **Cache results locally** - Store fetched data to avoid re-fetching the same records

## Tracking Your Usage

Monitor your quota usage in the **Profile Settings** section of your account. Usage counts are refreshed nightly.
