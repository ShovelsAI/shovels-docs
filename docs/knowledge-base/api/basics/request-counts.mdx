**The Shovels API uses a record-based credit system.** Each record returned by an API call counts against your credits. A permit search that returns 100 results uses 100 credits, while a detail lookup for a single permit uses 1 credit.

## How Credits Are Counted

Your credits are based on **records returned**, not the number of API calls you make:

- A search returning **100 permits** = **100 credits used**
- A search returning **50 contractors** = **50 credits used**
- A detail lookup for **1 permit** = **1 credit used**
- A detail lookup for **3 contractors** = **3 credits used**

This applies to all endpoints:
- Search endpoints (`GET /v2/permits/search`, `GET /v2/contractors/search`)
- Detail endpoints (`GET /v2/permits`, `GET /v2/contractors`)

## Practical Examples

| Request | Records Returned | Credits Used |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| `GET /v2/permits/search?size=100` | 100 permits | 100 |
| `GET /v2/permits/search?size=100` | 47 permits | 47 |
| `GET /v2/permits?id=123` | 1 permit | 1 |
| `GET /v2/contractors/search?size=50` | 50 contractors | 50 |
| `GET /v2/contractors?id=abc,def,ghi` | 3 contractors | 3 |

<Info>
The same credit system applies whether you're on the free trial or a paid plan.

## Managing Your Credits

1. **Use filters effectively** - Narrow your searches to return only the records you need
2. **Use search endpoints** - They include full details in the response, avoiding extra lookups
3. **Cache results locally** - Store fetched data to avoid re-fetching the same records

## Tracking Your Usage

### Via API

Use the `GET /v2/usage` endpoint to check your credit consumption:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/usage" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "credits_used": 150,
  "credit_limit": 250
}
```

### Via Response Headers

Every API response includes credit tracking headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Credits-Request` | Credits consumed by this request |
| `X-Credits-Limit` | Your total credit limit (omitted if unlimited) |
| `X-Credits-Remaining` | Credits remaining (omitted if unlimited) |

### Via Profile Settings

You can also view credit usage in the **Profile Settings** section of your account at [app.shovels.ai](https://app.shovels.ai/profile-settings/).

<Info>
Credits operate on a **30-day rolling window**. Your usage resets based on when credits were consumed, not on a fixed calendar date.
