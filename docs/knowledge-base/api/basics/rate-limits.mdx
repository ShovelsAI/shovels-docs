**The Shovels API free trial includes 250 credits with no time limit.** We don't enforce strict rate limits, but we monitor usage and may apply limits on an individual basis if needed. Contact sales for higher credit allocations.

## Free Trial Limits

The API free trial provides **250 credits** with no time limit or credit card required. If you need more credits during your trial, contact [sales@shovels.ai](mailto:sales@shovels.ai) for an extension.

## Paid Plan Limits

We don't enforce hard rate limits for paid plans, but we expect reasonable usage that respects our platform. We monitor usage and will reach out if we notice unusual patterns.

## If You Hit Your Limit

If your API key appears to be rate-limited, contact [support@shovels.ai](mailto:support@shovels.ai) for clarification.

For full details on API usage policies, see the [API Introduction](/docs/shovels-api-introduction#acceptable-use-policy).

## Understanding Your Credits

### Records Per Call

Search endpoints return up to **100 records per page** (default: 50) by setting the `size` parameter. Detail endpoints accept up to **50 IDs** per call. Each record returned counts against your credits—so a call returning 100 permits uses 100 credits.

### Efficient Querying

- Use search endpoints to get multiple records at once
- Search responses include full detail payloads—no separate detail call needed
- Use filters to get exactly the data you need

## Tracking Your Usage

Monitor your API usage in the **Profile Settings** section of your account or via the `GET /v2/usage` endpoint. Credits operate on a **30-day rolling window**—your usage resets based on when credits were consumed, not on a fixed calendar date.
