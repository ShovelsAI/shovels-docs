**The Shovels API free trial includes 250 requests with no time limit.** We don't enforce strict rate limits, but we monitor usage and may apply limits on an individual basis if needed. Contact sales for higher request allocations.

## Free Trial Limits

The API free trial provides **250 requests** with no time limit or credit card required. If you need more requests during your trial, contact [sales@shovels.ai](mailto:sales@shovels.ai) for an extension.

## Paid Plan Limits

We don't enforce hard rate limits for paid plans, but we expect reasonable usage that respects our platform. We monitor usage and will reach out if we notice unusual patterns.

## If You Hit Your Limit

If your API key appears to be rate-limited, contact [support@shovels.ai](mailto:support@shovels.ai) for clarification.

For full details on API usage policies, see the [API Introduction](/docs/shovels-api-introduction#acceptable-use-policy).

## Maximizing Your Requests

### Records Per Request

You can retrieve up to **100 permits or contractors** in a single API call by setting the `size` parameter to 100. Whether you retrieve 1 record or 100, it counts as only one request.

### Efficient Querying

- Use search endpoints to get multiple records at once
- Search responses include full detail payloads—no separate detail call needed
- Use filters to get exactly the data you need

## Tracking Your Usage

Monitor your API usage in the **Profile Settings** section of your account. Usage counts are refreshed nightly.
