**An API endpoint is a specific URL that represents a particular function or query.** The Shovels API (v2) provides access to permits, contractors, addresses, and supporting resources. For complete endpoint documentation, see the [API Reference](/api-reference).

## Main Endpoint Categories

| Category | Base Path | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Permits** | `/v2/permits/*` | Building permit data |
| **Contractors** | `/v2/contractors/*` | Contractor information |
| **Addresses** | `/v2/addresses/*` | Address resolution to geo_ids |
| **Lists** | `/v2/lists/*` | Predefined values (tags, property types) |
| **Meta** | `/v2/meta/*` | API metadata and release info |

## Search vs Detail Endpoints

- **Search endpoints** return multiple records based on filters
- **Detail endpoints** return specific records by ID

<Info>
Search responses include full detail payloads—you usually don't need a separate detail call.
