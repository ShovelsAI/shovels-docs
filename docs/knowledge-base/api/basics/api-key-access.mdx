Your API key is required to authenticate all requests to the Shovels API.

## Accessing Your API Key

1. [Log into your Shovels account](https://app.shovels.ai/profile-settings/)
2. Navigate to the **Profile Settings** section
3. Your API key is displayed in the **API Key** field

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the header of every API request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/meta/release" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## Free Trial API Access

New accounts receive **quota for 250 records** to explore our capabilities before committing to a paid plan.

<Info>
Each record returned by the API counts against your quota. A search returning 100 permits uses 100 quota; a single permit lookup uses 1 quota.
</Info>
