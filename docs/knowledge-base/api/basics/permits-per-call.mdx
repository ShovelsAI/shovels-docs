title: "How Many Permits Can I Retrieve Per API Call?"
description: "Learn about the maximum number of permits you can retrieve in a single Shovels API call and how to paginate through larger result sets."
---

You can retrieve a maximum of **100 permits per API call**.

## Setting the Page Size

Use the `size` parameter to control how many records are returned:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/permits/search?geo_id=94103&size=100" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## Pagination for Larger Results

If you need more than 100 permits, paginate through the results using the `next_cursor` value provided in the response.

### Cursor-Based Pagination

1. Make your initial request
2. Check the response for `next_cursor`
3. Use that cursor value in your next request
4. Repeat until no more results

```bash
# First request
GET /v2/permits/search?geo_id=CA&size=100

# Subsequent requests with cursor
GET /v2/permits/search?geo_id=CA&size=100&cursor=CURSOR_VALUE
```

<Tip>
Your API quota is based on records returned—a call returning 100 permits uses 100 quota, while a call returning 1 permit uses 1 quota.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- Always set `size=100` to maximize records per request
- Handle pagination in your code to process complete datasets
- Store results locally to avoid re-fetching the same data
