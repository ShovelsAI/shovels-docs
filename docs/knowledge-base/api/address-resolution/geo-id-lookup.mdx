**A geo_id is Shovels' unified geographic identifier that can represent a state (`CA`), zip code (`94103`), city, or specific address.** To get a geo_id for an address, use the Address Search endpoint (`GET /v2/addresses/search`). The returned geo_id is then used to query permits.

## Using Address Search

The address search endpoint returns the `geo_id` associated with an address:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/addresses/search?street=123+Main+St&city=San+Francisco&state=CA&zip=94102" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## Understanding geo_id

The `geo_id` is a unified geography identifier that works at multiple levels:

| Geography Level | Example geo_id |
|----------------|----------------|
| State | `CA` |
| Zip Code | `94103` |
| City | City-specific ID |
| Address | Address-specific ID |

<Tip>
The same permit search works whether you pass a state abbreviation, zip code, or individual address geo_id—you're just changing the geography level.
</Tip>

## geo_id for State Searches

For state-level searches, use the 2-letter state abbreviation as the geo_id:
- California = `CA`
- Texas = `TX`
- Florida = `FL`

```bash
GET /v2/permits/search?geo_id=CA&permit_from=2024-01-01
```

## What If No geo_id Is Found?

If the address isn't in our system, the API returns a 200 response with an empty `items` array. This means:
- The address format was understood
- No permits exist for that address in our database
