When using Shovels' API for address searches, it's important to understand how state and zip code parameters are processed.

## Key Behavior

**State and zip code parameters are not strictly validated** as part of geo_id resolution.

If you provide an incorrect state or zip code when searching for addresses:
- You won't receive an explicit error message
- The API returns a 200 OK response with an empty result set (`null` items)

## Why This Happens

This behavior is by design to accommodate variations in how addresses might be recorded across different jurisdictions.

## Best Practices

For the most reliable results:

1. **Focus on the street address** - Street name, number, and city are most important
2. **Verify location data** - Double-check state and zip codes before querying
3. **Handle empty results** - If you consistently get empty results for addresses you expect to find, verify the state and zip information

<Info>
Our system uses multiple address verification sources to ensure accuracy:
- National Address Dataset from the US Census
- Open Address dataset
- Simple Maps
- ESRI
</Info>

## Interpreting Empty Results

An empty result set can mean:
- The address exists but with different state/zip information
- The address doesn't have permits in our system
- There's a formatting mismatch in your query

## Troubleshooting

If you're getting unexpected empty results:
1. Try the query with just the street address and city
2. Verify the state abbreviation is correct (use 2-letter codes)
3. Check that the zip code matches the city
4. Search at a broader geography level first (city or zip) to confirm coverage
