Address resolution is the essential first step in using Shovels' API effectively.

## The Two-Step Process

1. **Resolve the address** - Get a `geo_id` from our Address Search endpoint
2. **Query permits** - Use the `geo_id` to retrieve permit data

## Step 1: Resolve the Address

Use the Address Search API endpoint to find addresses with permits in our system:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/addresses/search?street=123+Main+St&city=San+Francisco&state=CA" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

The response includes:
- Standardized address information
- A unique `geo_id`

## Step 2: Query Permits

Use the `geo_id` to retrieve permits:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/permits/search?geo_id=ADDRESS_GEO_ID&permit_from=2020-01-01" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## Why geo_id Matters

The `geo_id` system offers several advantages:
- **Consistent identification** regardless of address formatting variations
- **Stable reference point** even if address details change over time
- **Improved query performance** compared to direct address searching

<Info>
If the address doesn't have any permits in our database, the API returns a 200 OK response with an empty `items` array.
</Info>

## Best Practices

- Provide as much address information as possible (street number, name, city, state, ZIP)
- Our system standardizes addresses using multiple verification sources
- The `geo_id` parameter works at multiple levels: address, zip code, city, county, or state

## Alternative: Shovels Online

For quick lookups without code, use the **Location Search** feature in [Shovels Online](https://app.shovels.ai) to search by address directly.
