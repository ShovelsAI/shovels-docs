Contractor search returns B2B contact information, license data, and classification data about contractors who have pulled permits.

## Permit Search vs Contractor Search

| Search Type | Returns |
|-------------|---------|
| **Permit Search** | Permits pulled at specific addresses in a geographic area |
| **Contractor Search** | Contact information, license data, and classification data for contractors |

<Info>
Not every permit has an associated contractor. This depends on whether the jurisdiction requires contractor information on permit applications, and whether the contractor provides it.

## Searching for Contractors

### By Name

You can search by contractor name—either the full name or partial:

```bash
# Full name search
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/contractors/search?name=John+Smith+Panels" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Partial name search
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/contractors/search?name=Smith" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### By Geography

Search for contractors in a specific area:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.shovels.ai/v2/contractors/search?geo_id=94103" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## Fuzzy Matching

- **Address lookup** is fuzzy
- **Contractor lookup** is exact, or you can search by part of the name

For example, searching for "John Smith Panels" you can search by:
- "John"
- "Joh"
- "Sm"
- "Panels"
