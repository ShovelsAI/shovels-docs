Identifying independent contractors (ICs) in the Shovels API can be accomplished in several ways.

## Primary Method: biz_type Field

The most reliable method is through the `biz_type` field, though it has limited coverage across our dataset.

## Heuristic Indicators

As a practical heuristic, consider these signals:

### Business Name Analysis
If a business name appears to be a person's name (e.g., "John Smith" rather than "Smith Construction"), it often indicates an independent contractor.

### Other Signals

- **Single contact person** across all permits
- **Low permit volume** compared to larger firms
- **Absence of multiple employee records**

## Why It Matters

Independent contractors represent a significant portion of the contracting ecosystem, especially in specialized trades like:
- Electrical work
- Plumbing
- HVAC

Understanding which contractors are independent professionals versus larger companies allows for:
- More tailored marketing approaches
- Accurate market segmentation
- Better targeting for products or services
