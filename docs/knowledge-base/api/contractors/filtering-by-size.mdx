The Shovels API provides employee count data for contractors, allowing you to filter by company size.

## Employee Count in Response Data

When querying contractor endpoints, you'll receive employee count ranges in the response payload, enabling filtering by:
- Small businesses (fewer than 10 employees)
- Mid-size companies (10-100 employees)
- Enterprise-level contractors (100+ employees)

## How Company Size Is Determined

Our size classifications are determined through multiple data points:
- Business registrations
- Permit frequency
- Other proprietary indicators

## Use Cases

Filtering by company size is useful for:
- **Sales teams** segmenting outreach by company size
- **Marketing** targeting specific business sizes
- **Market analysis** understanding contractor landscape

## Example Workflow

1. Search for contractors in your target geography
2. Review employee count data in the response
3. Filter results based on your size requirements
4. Focus outreach on your target segment

<Info>
Employee count data coverage varies. Not all contractors have this information available.
