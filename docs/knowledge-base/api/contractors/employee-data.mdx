The Shovels API provides a dedicated endpoint to retrieve employee information for specific contractors, including contact details, job titles, and seniority levels.

## Using the Employees Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /contractors/{id}/employees`

### Required Parameters

- `{id}` - The contractor ID (path parameter)

### Optional Parameters

- `cursor` - For pagination through large result sets
- `page` - Page number for offset-based pagination
- `size` - Number of items per page (1-100)

## Sample Request

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.shovels.ai/v2/contractors/{id}/employees \
  --header 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
```

## Response Data

### Contact Information
- `email` - Personal email address
- `business_email` - Business email address
- `phone` - Phone number
- `linkedin_url` - LinkedIn profile

### Professional Details
- `job_title` - Current position
- `seniority_level` - Senior, Mid, Junior, etc.
- `department` - Department or division

### Additional Data
- `name` - Full name
- Address details (street, city, state, zip)
- Demographics (age range, income range, etc.)

## Scaling Your Data Collection

### Pagination

Use cursor-based pagination for large employee lists. Check for `next_cursor` in the response to retrieve subsequent pages.

### Bulk Processing

To process multiple contractors at scale:
1. Obtain contractor IDs using the contractors search endpoints
2. Iterate through each contractor ID
3. Call the employees endpoint for each contractor
4. Implement proper error handling and rate limiting

### Targeting Decision Makers

Filter results by `seniority_level` (Senior, Executive) and `job_title` to identify:
- Owners
- Sales directors
- Project managers
- Other key personnel

## Best Practices

- Respect rate limits and avoid frivolous requests
- Use pagination to handle large datasets efficiently
- Store and cache results to minimize API calls
- Filter by job titles and seniority levels to focus on decision-makers
- Always include proper error handling in your implementation
