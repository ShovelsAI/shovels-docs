title: "How to Find a Contractor's Service Area"
description: "Use the Shovels API to identify all cities and zip codes where a contractor has worked by analyzing their permit history."

Rather than relying on self-reported service areas, you can use a contractor's actual permit history to map their complete service footprint across cities and zip codes.

## Overview

By analyzing permit data, you can determine:
- All cities where a contractor has worked
- All zip codes in their service area
- Geographic coverage patterns over time

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Get Permits for a Contractor

Use the `/v2/permits/search` endpoint to retrieve permits for a specific contractor:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.shovels.ai/v2/permits/search?contractor_id=YOUR_CONTRACTOR_ID&permit_from=2022-01-01&permit_to=2024-12-31' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
```

<Info>
You need the contractor_id first. Get it by searching for the contractor using the contractors search endpoint.

### Step 2: Extract Geographic Data

From each permit record, extract:
- City/jurisdiction names
- Zip codes
- Any additional geographic identifiers

### Step 3: Create Unique Lists

Process the permit data to create deduplicated lists of:
- All cities where the contractor has worked
- All zip codes in their service area
- Geographic coverage patterns over time

## Best Practices

1. **Use Date Ranges** - Query recent permit data (last 2-3 years) for active service areas
2. **Handle Pagination** - Make sure to handle paginated responses to get complete permit histories
3. **Filter by Property Type** - Use `property_type` parameters to understand different service area patterns (residential vs commercial)

## Geographic Filtering Capabilities

The `geo_id` system enables precise searching by:
- Address
- Zip code
- Jurisdiction
- City
- County

This makes location-based queries powerful for understanding contractor coverage.

## Alternative: Shovels Online
