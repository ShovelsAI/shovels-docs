title: "What Does a 422 Error Mean in the Shovels API?"
description: "A 422 error means a required parameter is missing. Usually, you need to resolve your address to a geo_id first using the Address Search endpoint."
---

**A 422 error in the Shovels API means a required parameter is missing from your request.** The most common cause is querying permits without first resolving your address to a geo_id. Solution: Use the Address Search endpoint to get a geo_id, then use that geo_id in your permit query.

## Common Causes

### Missing geo_id

If you query permits without including a geo_id:

```json
{
  "detail": "Invalid geolocation ID value. Have you resolved your address into Shovels geolocation ID?"
}
```

### Invalid geo_id Format

If the geo_id format is incorrect or wasn't obtained through address resolution.

## How to Fix

1. **Resolve the address first** - Use the Address Search API to get a valid geo_id
2. **Check required parameters** - Review the API documentation for required fields
3. **Review the error message** - The JSON output helps identify what's missing

## Example Workflow

```bash
# WRONG: Querying permits without resolving address first
GET /v2/permits/search?street=123+Main+St  # Will return 422

# RIGHT: Resolve address, then query permits
GET /v2/addresses/search?street=123+Main+St&city=San+Francisco&state=CA
# Get geo_id from response, then:
GET /v2/permits/search?geo_id=RESOLVED_GEO_ID
```

<Tip>
Always check the error response body—it tells you exactly what's missing or invalid.
