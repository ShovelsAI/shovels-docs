A comprehensive glossary of terms used throughout Shovels documentation, API, and data products.

## A

### Address ID
A unique identifier assigned by Shovels to each distinct address in our database. The address ID remains consistent even if the address formatting varies across different permits, enabling you to link all permits at a single property.

### AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction)
The governmental body responsible for issuing building permits in a specific geographic area. An AHJ is typically a city or county government that establishes building codes, conducts inspections, and maintains permit records. The United States has approximately 20,000 AHJs.

### API Key
A unique authentication token required to access the Shovels API. Include it in the `X-API-Key` header of every request. Access your key at [app.shovels.ai/profile-settings](https://app.shovels.ai/profile-settings/).

### Active (Permit Status)
A permit status indicating the permit has been approved and issued. Work can proceed. Defined by the `issue_date` field.

### Area Rezoning
A zoning change applied to a larger geographic area, often initiated by municipalities as part of comprehensive planning efforts. Area rezonings indicate broader market shifts and can affect property values across many parcels.

## C

### Contractor ID
A unique identifier assigned by Shovels to each contractor. Contractor IDs are deduplicated within each state, meaning the same contractor operating in multiple states will have separate IDs per state.

### Contractor Group ID
An identifier linking multiple contractors that operate under the same parent organization. For example, regional branches of a national company share the same group ID.

## D

### Decision (Shovels Decision)
A structured record of a municipal zoning or land use decision extracted from city council and planning department meetings. Decisions capture rezoning approvals, special use permits, variances, and zoning code modifications—often months before permits are filed.

### Decision Category
The classification of a zoning action type. Primary categories include Spot Rezoning, Area Rezoning, Zoning Code Modification, and Special Use Permit. Subcategories provide additional context such as Inclusionary Zoning, Variance, or Planned Unit Development (PUD).

### Deduplication
The process of identifying and consolidating duplicate records. Shovels deduplicates permits (maintaining one record per permit even with status updates) and contractors (linking related business entities).

## E

### EDL (Enterprise Data License)
Shovels' bulk data product for enterprise customers. EDL delivers complete datasets to data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks, with more fields than the API and monthly refresh cycles.

## F

### File Date
The date when a permit application was submitted to the jurisdiction. This marks the beginning of the permit lifecycle.

### Final (Permit Status)
A permit status indicating the project is complete and has passed final inspection. Defined by the `final_date` field.

### Final Date
The date when a permit received final approval after passing all required inspections.

### First Seen Date
The date when Shovels first discovered a permit in our data collection process. Used by EDL customers to identify new records in monthly deliveries.

## G

### geo_id
A unified geographic identifier used by Shovels to link addresses to permit data. A geo_id can represent different geographic levels: a state (`CA`), zip code (`94103`), city, county, or specific address. Use the Address Search API to obtain a geo_id for any location.

### Geocoding
The process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). Shovels performs geocoding in-house using multiple reference sources including the National Address Dataset, Open Address, Simple Maps, and ESRI.

## I

### Inactive (Permit Status)
A permit status indicating the permit process has stalled. Reasons include failed inspections, permit expiration, or inactivity for more than 180 days.

### In Review (Permit Status)
A permit status indicating the application has been submitted and is awaiting approval. Defined by the `file_date` field.

### is_representative
A boolean field in EDL data indicating whether a contractor record is the primary representative of a contractor group. When `TRUE`, this record contains the canonical information for the entire group.

### Issue Date
The date when a permit was approved and issued by the jurisdiction, allowing construction work to begin.

## J

### Jurisdiction
The geographic area governed by a specific AHJ. Shovels covers approximately 2,000 jurisdictions representing about 85% of the US population.

## N

### NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)
A modern industry classification system used to categorize businesses. More specific than SIC codes but less widely adopted. Available in Shovels contractor data.

### Newsworthiness
A confidence score (0-1) in Shovels Decision data indicating the relevance and significance of a zoning decision. Higher scores suggest decisions with greater potential impact on development activity.

## O

### Over-the-Counter Permit
A permit approved immediately without requiring follow-up inspections. Common for simple projects like solar installations or minor plumbing work. These permits may have a "final" status without a final date.

## P

### Parquet
A columnar data storage format optimized for analytics. Shovels EDL data is typically delivered as 15-20 GB of Parquet files.

### Permit ID
A unique identifier generated by Shovels for each permit. Unlike permit numbers (which may duplicate across jurisdictions), Shovels permit IDs are globally unique and persistent throughout the permit lifecycle.

### Permit Number (permit_no)
The permit number assigned by the issuing jurisdiction. Not globally unique—different jurisdictions may assign the same number to different permits. Use Shovels' permit ID for unique identification.

### Primary Email
The most frequently used email address across all permits for a given contractor. Determined by analyzing frequency across the contractor's permit history.

### Primary Phone
The most frequently used phone number across all permits for a given contractor.

### PUD (Planned Unit Development)
A flexible zoning classification for master-planned projects that allows developers to negotiate custom development standards. PUDs often appear as a subcategory in Shovels Decision data.

## R

### Rate Limit / Credits
The maximum number of records you can retrieve via the API. Free trials include 250 credits. Each record returned counts against your credits. Paid plans have custom limits—contact sales for details. See [API rate limits](/docs/knowledge-base/api/basics/rate-limits) for full information.

## S

### SIC (Standard Industrial Classification)
An older industry classification system used to categorize businesses. More widely adopted than NAICS codes. Available in Shovels contractor data.

### Special Use Permit
Permission granted by a municipality to conduct a specific activity that isn't automatically allowed in a zone but may be approved with conditions. Also called conditional use permits in some jurisdictions. Special use permits often precede specific business or development activity at a known location.

### Shovels Online
The web-based application for searching and downloading permit and contractor data. Access at [app.shovels.ai](https://app.shovels.ai).

### Spot Rezoning
A zoning change applied to a specific property or small group of parcels, typically initiated by property owners or developers seeking to change what can be built on their land. Spot rezonings often signal imminent development activity on that specific property.

### Start Date
The first date recorded for a permit in Shovels' system. Generated by Shovels based on collected permit data.

## T

### Tags
Shovels-assigned categories that classify permits by work type (e.g., solar, HVAC, electrical, roofing). Use the `/list/tags` endpoint to get valid tag values.

## U

### Unknown (Permit Status)
A permit status indicating insufficient data to determine the current state. May result from incomplete jurisdiction records or missing date information.

## V

### Variance
An exception to specific zoning requirements granted by a municipality. Variances allow property owners to deviate from regulations such as setbacks, height limits, or lot coverage when strict compliance would cause undue hardship.

## Z

### Zoning Code Modification
Changes to zoning regulations themselves, rather than the zoning designation of specific properties. These modify what's allowed within existing zones (e.g., adjusting height limits, adding ADUs as permitted use, modifying parking requirements) and can unlock development potential across all properties in affected zones.
