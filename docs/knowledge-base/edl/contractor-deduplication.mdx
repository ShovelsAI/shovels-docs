Shovels assigns unique contractor IDs and works to deduplicate contractors across the permits we collect.

## How Deduplication Works

We assign a **unique contractor_ID** to any contractor we see in our system and work to ensure this ID is:
- Deduplicated within the dataset
- A unique identifier for each contractor

## Contractor IDs in Permits

In our permits table, we include the `contractor_ID` whenever there is an associated contractor.

## Contractor Groups

If we believe a unique contractor is associated with a larger group or parent company, we also associate that `contractor_ID` with a `contractor group_ID`.

**Example:** If we see a local plumber and believe they are a local branch of a regional plumbing company, both would share the same `group_ID`.

## State-Level Deduplication

Currently, we deduplicate contractors **per state**. This means:
- The same contractor ID will **not** appear across different states
- If ABC Plumbing Inc does business in both CA and AZ, it will have **2 unique contractor_IDs**

<Info>
We are working on creating a national contractor ID system. Check our blog for the latest announcements.

## The is_representative Field

For EDL deliveries, the `is_representative` field indicates whether a contractor record is the main representative of a `group_id`.

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `is_representative = TRUE` | This record contains the canonical/preferred information for the entire group |
| `is_representative = FALSE` | This is a related contractor in the group |

### Why This Matters

This feature helps:
- Prevent double-counting of organizations operating under multiple names
- Avoid reaching out to the same organization multiple times
- Enable more accurate market analysis
