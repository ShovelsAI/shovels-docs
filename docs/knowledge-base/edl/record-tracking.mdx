For EDL customers receiving monthly data overwrites, tracking whether a record is new versus pre-existing and modified can be accomplished using the `first_seen_date` field.

## Using first_seen_date

The `first_seen_date` field in the PERMITS table indicates when Shovels first discovered the permit in our data collection process.

### Identifying New Records

Compare `first_seen_date` with your previous data delivery:
- Records where `first_seen_date` falls **after** your last update are **new**
- Records where `first_seen_date` falls **before** your last update are **existing**

### Example Logic

```sql
-- New permits since last delivery (Jan 15)
SELECT * FROM permits
WHERE first_seen_date > '2024-01-15'
```

## Tracking Modifications

Currently, there is no specific flag indicating changes in records. To identify modifications to existing records:

1. **Maintain previous deliveries** - Keep a copy of your previous data
2. **Compare key fields** - Focus on fields that might change:
   - Status
   - Valuation
   - Dates
   - Other attributes
3. **Build comparison logic** - Create queries that identify differences

We're actively working on enhancing our data delivery system to include explicit change tracking flags in future releases.

## Best Practices

1. Store the `first_seen_date` for your comparison baseline
2. Maintain at least one previous delivery for modification tracking
3. Focus comparisons on fields relevant to your use case
4. Consider building automated comparison pipelines
