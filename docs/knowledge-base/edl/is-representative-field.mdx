In Shovels' Enterprise Data License (EDL) deliveries, the `is_representative` field helps you understand contractor group relationships.

## What It Means

The `is_representative` field is a boolean that indicates whether a contractor record is the **main representative** of a `contractor group_id`.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `TRUE` | This record contains the canonical/preferred information for the entire group |
| `FALSE` | This is a related contractor in the group, not the primary record |

## How Group IDs Work

The `group_id` is a unique identifier that links together multiple contractors operating under the same parent organization.

**Example:** A national HVAC company might pull permits under regional subsidiaries. Our grouping algorithm:
1. Identifies these relationships
2. Links them with a shared `group_id`
3. Designates one record as the representative

## Why This Matters

### Prevent Double-Counting

When analyzing large contractor datasets, `is_representative` helps prevent counting the same organization multiple times under different names or licenses.

### Avoid Duplicate Outreach

Use the representative record to avoid contacting the same organization through different subsidiary entries.

### Accurate Market Analysis

Get a true count of unique contractor organizations, not just contractor records.

## Using is_representative

```sql
-- Get unique contractor organizations (one per group)
SELECT * FROM contractors
WHERE is_representative = TRUE

-- Get all contractors including subsidiaries
SELECT * FROM contractors
```
