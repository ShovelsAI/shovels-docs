For Enterprise Data License (EDL) customers, Shovels employs an **overwrite approach** when pushing data to your data warehouse.

## How It Works

Each monthly delivery is treated as a **fresh table**, completely replacing the previous month's data with the updated dataset.

### Benefits

This approach simplifies data management by:
- Eliminating the need to merge incremental updates
- Providing a complete, consistent dataset each delivery
- Avoiding complex change-tracking logic

## ID Stability

**Critically important:** Our IDs remain static and don't change from release to release:
- Permit IDs
- Address IDs
- Contractor IDs

This consistency ensures that any scripts, analyses, or processes relying on these IDs won't be impacted by the monthly refresh.

<Info>
The stability of our ID system allows customers to build reliable data pipelines and maintain referential integrity.

## What's Included

Each monthly delivery includes:
- All historical data
- New permits added since last delivery
- Updates to existing records (status changes, etc.)

This provides a complete and current view of the construction permitting landscape.

## Tracking Changes

For customers who need to track changes between deliveries, we recommend:
- Using the `first_seen_date` field to identify new records
- Comparing status change indicators between deliveries
- Maintaining a copy of previous deliveries for comparison

## Delivery Schedule

EDL data is refreshed on the same schedule as our main database:
- 1st of the month
- 15th of the month
