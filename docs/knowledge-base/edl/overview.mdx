**The Shovels Enterprise Data License (EDL) delivers complete permit and contractor datasets directly to your data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks) or as Parquet files.** EDL includes more fields than the API and is best for bulk data analysis, while the API is better for real-time lookups and integrations.
