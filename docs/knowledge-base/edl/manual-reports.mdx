Users can request manual reports from the Shovels support team for specific data needs.

## How to Request a Manual Report

### Contact Support

Reach out to the Shovels support team via:
- Email: [sales@shovels.ai](mailto:sales@shovels.ai)
- [Contact Us form](https://www.shovels.ai/contact)
- Phone

### Specify Your Needs

When requesting a report, clearly describe:
- **Type of report** you need
- **Specific data points** required
- **Desired format** (CSV, Parquet, etc.)
- **Geographic scope** (states, cities, etc.)
- **Date ranges** if applicable

### Provide Examples

If possible, share an example of the report format you're looking for to help create the report to your specifications.

## Example Use Cases

- **Contractor-specific data** - "I need a list of all solar permits pulled by Vivint or Solar City"
- **Historical data** - "I need an all-time history report, not just the last 12 months"
- **Custom filters** - "Commercial permits for motels, hotels, and restaurants in California"

## Current Limitations

- The web app allows access to data only for the last 12 months unless manually adjusted
- There may be limits on export sizes, so request smaller batches or use specific filters if needed

## Best Practices

1. Be as specific as possible about your data requirements
2. Include examples when you can
3. Specify any particular format requirements
4. Indicate urgency if applicable

<Info>
As the platform continues to evolve, more self-service report generation capabilities are expected in the future.
