Resident and homeowner email contact information is available through multiple fields in EDL data.

## Where to Find Contact Information

### PERMITS Table

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `APPLICANT_EMAIL` | Email of the permit applicant (may be homeowner, builder, or contractor depending on who applied) |
| `OWNER_EMAIL` | Property owner email at time of permit submission |

<Info>
Note: Owner email reflects ownership at the time of permit submission, which may have changed if the permit is old.
</Info>

### RESIDENTS Table

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `PERSONAL_EMAILS` | Personal email addresses for residents |
| `BUSINESS_EMAIL` | Business email addresses |
| `HOMEOWNER` | Filter for `HOMEOWNER = Y` to get homeowner contacts |

## Identifying Homeowners

To get homeowner-specific contact information:

```sql
SELECT personal_emails, business_email, name, phone
FROM residents
WHERE homeowner = 'Y'
```

## API Access

For API users, access resident contact info by:
1. Get the `address_id` from a permit object
2. Pass it to the [residents endpoint](/api-reference/addresses/get-residents)

```bash
GET /v2/addresses/{address_id}/residents
```

This returns contact info including name, phone, and email for occupants associated with the address.

## EDL vs API Differences

| Data Point | EDL | API |
|------------|-----|-----|
| Applicant email | Yes | No |
| Owner email | Yes | No |
