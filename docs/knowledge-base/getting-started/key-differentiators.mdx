**Shovels stands out from other permit data providers through four key differentiators: (1) USPS-standardized, geocoded addresses, (2) comprehensive contractor data with parent-company grouping, (3) 98% classification accuracy using AI validated by industry experts, and (4) sophisticated deduplication that maintains consistent IDs across updates.** We source directly from jurisdictions—never from third-party resellers.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Very Clean Data

Our addresses are standardized to USPS format and geotagged with coordinates. We cross-reference against multiple authoritative datasets:
- National Address Dataset from the US Census
- Open Address dataset
- Simple Maps
- ESRI

### 2. Comprehensive Contractor Data

Our contractor data is derived directly from permit metadata, including **contractor grouping** that links contractors under the same parent organization. This helps you understand relationships between:
- Local branches and regional offices
- DBA names and parent companies
- Related business entities

### 3. Modern Data Infrastructure

We use AI and machine learning with a documented **98% accuracy** rate validated by construction industry experts. Our rigorous data labeling process involves:
- Multiple independent annotators
- Manual review for divergent responses
- Golden datasets for benchmarking

### 4. Sophisticated Deduplication

Our system maintains a unique identifier for each permit and updates records as permit statuses change, rather than creating duplicate entries. This means:
- Consistent permit IDs throughout the lifecycle
- No duplicate records from status updates
- Reliable tracking across data refreshes

## Data Sources

We source data directly from jurisdictions through:
- Direct relationships with local governments
- Integration with online permitting portals
- Public records requests where needed

We don't purchase data from other sources—we get it straight from the source.
