## API Basics

### What is my API credit limit?
The free trial includes 250 credits. Paid plans have custom limits—no hard rate limits are enforced, but we monitor usage. Contact [sales@shovels.ai](mailto:sales@shovels.ai) for details.

### How many records per API call?
Search endpoints return up to 100 records per page (default: 50). Detail endpoints accept up to 50 IDs per call.

### How do API credits work?
Each record returned counts against your credits. A search returning 100 permits uses 100 credits; a single permit lookup uses 1 credit.

### Where do I find my API key?
Log in at [app.shovels.ai/profile-settings](https://app.shovels.ai/profile-settings/) and find it in the API Key section.

### What does a 422 error mean?
A required parameter is missing. Most commonly, you need to resolve an address to a geo_id first using the Address Search endpoint.

## Data Coverage

### What areas does Shovels cover?
Approximately 2,000 jurisdictions covering about 85% of the US population.

### How far back does the data go?
At least 2010 for all jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions have data going back further.

### How often is data updated?
Monthly. We add 5-10 million new records and 1-5 million status updates each month.

### Where does Shovels get its data?
Directly from jurisdictions through relationships with local governments, online permitting portals, and public records requests. We don't purchase data from other vendors.

---

## Permits

### What is a geo_id?
A unique geographic identifier that can represent a state (`CA`), zip code (`94103`), city, county, or specific address. Use the Address Search API to get a geo_id.

### What are the permit statuses?
- **in_review**: Application submitted, awaiting approval
- **active**: Approved, work can proceed
- **final**: Completed, passed inspection
- **inactive**: Stalled, expired, or abandoned

### Why do some permits have no address?
New construction permits are often filed before official addresses exist. These permits have state and jurisdiction info but no address ID.

### What's the difference between permit ID and permit number?
**Permit ID**: Globally unique identifier generated by Shovels.
**Permit number**: Assigned by the jurisdiction—may duplicate across different cities.

---

## Contractors

### How is contractor data organized?
Each contractor has a unique contractor ID (deduplicated within each state). Related contractors share a group ID linking them to parent organizations.

### What contact information is available?
Business name, address, phone numbers (primary and all known), email addresses, license numbers, and employee data (via API endpoint).

### Are contractors deduplicated across states?
No. The same contractor operating in multiple states has separate IDs per state. National deduplication is in development.

## Shovels Online

### What can I do with the free trial?
Search permits and contractors, use filters, and explore the last 12 months of data. CSV downloads require a paid plan.

### How does search work?
Searches use AND logic—results match ALL selected criteria. You can search by geography, date range, permit type, keywords, and more.

---

## Enterprise (EDL)

### What formats are available?
Parquet (preferred), CSV, or JSON. Typical delivery size is 15-20 GB.

### Where can data be delivered?
Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, or as downloadable files.

### How do I track new records in monthly deliveries?
Use the `first_seen_date` field. Records with `first_seen_date` after your last delivery are new.
