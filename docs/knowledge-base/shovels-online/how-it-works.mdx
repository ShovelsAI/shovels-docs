Shovels Online is a powerful web-based tool to help you find building permits and contractors anywhere in the USA.

## Search Functionality

### How Does the Search Work?

The Shovels dashboard uses an **"AND" search logic**. When you select multiple search criteria, the results show permits that match ALL selected criteria, not just one or the other.

### Keyword Search

You can search by description keywords. This is useful for finding:
- Specific brand names (like Tesla)
- Building materials
- Equipment types (such as heat pumps)

<Info>
The search system does not account for typos or terminology variations. Contractors may use different abbreviations (like "SFR" instead of "single family residence"), so keep this in mind when searching.

## Permit Statuses

Permits in Shovels Online can have the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Applied For** | The permit is in review |
| **Active** | The permit has been approved |
| **Finaled** | The permit is fully completed |
| **Inactive** | No date changes observed for this permit in a while |

## Contractor Search

Search for contractors based on the types of permits they've pulled. The contractor search provides:

- Business names
- Total lifetime number of permits pulled
- Detailed contractor information (for subscribers)
- Contact information
- History of permits pulled

<Warning>
Not all permits include contractor information. Some jurisdictions don't require contractors to provide their contact details.
</Warning>

## Permit Search

When viewing permits, you'll see:
- Permit status
- Address (when available)
- Detailed information about the work being done

Note that some permits may not have addresses—this is common with new construction permits where an address hasn't been assigned yet.

## Data Export

Paying customers can download search results as CSV files. This feature is not available on trial accounts.
