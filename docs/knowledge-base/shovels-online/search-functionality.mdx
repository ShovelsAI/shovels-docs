Shovels Online provides powerful search capabilities for finding permits and contractors.

## Permit Search vs Contractor Search

| Search Type | Returns |
|-------------|---------|
| **Permit Search** | Permits pulled on specific addresses in the geographic area you searched |
| **Contractor Search** | B2B contact information, license data, and classification data about contractors who pulled those permits |

<Info>
Not every permit will have an associated contractor. This depends on whether the jurisdiction requires contractor information on permit applications.
</Info>

## Search Logic

The dashboard uses **"AND" search logic**. When you select multiple criteria, results match ALL selected criteria, not just one.

**Example:** If you search for:
- Location: San Francisco
- Permit type: Solar
- Date range: 2024

You'll get permits that match **all three** criteria.

## Keyword Search

Search by description keywords to find:
- Brand names (e.g., "Tesla", "Carrier")
- Building materials
- Equipment types (e.g., "heat pump", "HVAC")
- Specific work types

### Search Tips

- The system doesn't account for typos
- Try different terminology variations
- Contractors use different abbreviations:
  - "SFR" = Single Family Residence
  - "A/C" = Air Conditioning
  - "WH" = Water Heater

## What Permit Search Shows

For each permit, you'll see:
- Permit status
- Address (when available)
- Description of work
- Filing and completion dates
- Associated contractor (if available)

## What Contractor Search Shows

For each contractor:
- Business name
- Total lifetime permits pulled
- Contact information (subscribers)
- License status
- Permit history
