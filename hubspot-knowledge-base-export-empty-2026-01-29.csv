While there isn't a specific change flag in the current data schema, this timestamp indicates when Shovels first discovered the permit in our data collection process. By comparing first_seen_date with your previous data delivery, you can identify new records where the first_seen_date falls after your last update. For modifications to existing records, you'll need to implement a comparison between the current and previous data deliveries, focusing on fields like status, valuation, or other attributes that might change over time. This approach requires maintaining a copy of previous deliveries for comparison purposes. We're actively working on enhancing our data delivery system to include explicit change tracking flags in future releases, which will simplify this process for customers who need to monitor specific changes in the permit landscape.","EDL","Data Updates","change tracking,first_seen_date,data updates,EDL,record modifications","1769212660064","PUBLISHED","false"

"Shovels Knowledge Base","What is a Jurisdiction?","Understanding the governmental entities that issue permits","en","https://support.shovels.ai/faq/jurisdiction-definition","<p>In the context of Shovels data, a jurisdiction refers to the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) - the governmental body responsible for issuing building permits in a specific geographic area. This is typically either a county or a city government. Jurisdictions play a crucial role in the construction permitting process as they establish and enforce building codes, conduct inspections, and maintain official records of construction activities. Nationwide, there are approximately 20,000 different jurisdictions, each with their own specific requirements, processes, and data formats. Shovels has standardized data from over 1,400 jurisdictions, covering approximately 80% of the US population. Understanding which jurisdiction governs a particular property is essential for contractors and service providers, as it determines which rules apply and which office must approve permits.

This approach simplifies data management by eliminating the need to merge incremental updates. Importantly, our permit IDs, address IDs, and contractor IDs remain static and don't change from release to release. This consistency ensures that any scripts, analyses, or processes that rely on these IDs won't be impacted by the monthly refresh. The stability of our ID system allows customers to build reliable data pipelines and maintain referential integrity in their analyses. Each monthly delivery includes all historical data plus new permits and updates, providing a complete and current view of the construction permitting landscape.

"Shovels Knowledge Base","The Data Labeling and Annotation Process","How Shovels ensures accuracy in permit classification","en","https://support.shovels.ai/faq/data-labeling-process","Shovels employs a rigorous data labeling and annotation process to ensure high-quality, accurately classified permit data. Our approach involves multiple independent annotators labeling each record, with manual review and resolution in cases where their responses diverge. The validation sample size is proportionate to the representation of each category within the total dataset, typically including between 1-5% of the overall data to ensure adequate validation points for every category. A key aspect of our methodology is having annotators independently solve the task rather than validating model outputs. This prevents annotator bias and creates a ""golden dataset"" of correct answers that can be used to benchmark any new model outputs across iterations without requiring fresh human validation each time. This approach has proven particularly effective for accurately classifying permit descriptions, which often contain industry-specific terminology, abbreviations, and inconsistent formatting.

In these cases, Shovels assigns a unique permit ID to track the permit, but there won't be an associated address ID, physical address, or geographic identifiers such as county, city, or jurisdiction codes. The only geo-identifiers included with these address-less permits will be state and jurisdiction information. These permits are still valuable data points as they often represent new construction projects at their earliest stages. For users interested in new development opportunities, these permits can provide early intelligence about upcoming construction activity. As the project progresses and an official address is assigned, we update our records to link the permit with its new address, allowing for continuous tracking throughout the construction lifecycle.

As updates are made to the permit - such as status changes, valuation adjustments, or contractor assignments - we update the data while maintaining the same permit ID. This approach ensures a continuous record of the permit's progression without creating duplicate entries. The permit lifecycle typically flows through several stages: filing (status: in_review), approval (status: active), and completion (status: final). If a permit is abandoned or revoked, its status changes to inactive. For each status change, we update the corresponding date fields (file_date, issued_date, final_date) while maintaining the same unique identifier.

This is because our system captures data differently for these two fields. Contact names are specific to individual permits and represent the name provided on that particular permit application. However, primary_email addresses are determined by analyzing frequency across all permits for a given contractor. For example, if John Smith is listed as the contact on a specific permit, but jane.doe@company.com appears most frequently across all of that contractor's permits, the primary_email field will show Jane's email rather than John's. This approach ensures you have the most actively used contact point for the company, which increases the likelihood of successful communication.

"Shovels Knowledge Base","How do I find a contractor's service area?","Use the Shovels API to identify all cities and zip codes where a contractor has worked by analyzing their permit history","en","https://support.shovels.ai/how-do-i-find-a-contractors-service-area","<p>Understanding where contractors operate is crucial for expanding coverage to lesser-served regions. Rather than relying on self-reported service areas, you can use a contractor's actual permit history to map their complete service footprint across cities and zip codes.</p>
<h3 data-hsprotectlevel=""3"">Overview</h3>
<p>The Shovels API provides access to permit and contractor data, allowing you to programmatically access building permit and contractor information. The API offers access to two primary objects: Permits and Contractors, with permits being official documents issued by city or county authorities required before commencing construction or alterations to a building.</p>
<h3 data-hsprotectlevel=""3"">How It Works</h3>
<p>To determine a contractor's service area, you'll analyze their permit history to create a unique list of cities and zip codes where they've worked. This approach provides concrete evidence of their actual operating territories rather than claimed service areas.</p>
<h3 data-hsprotectlevel=""3"">API Authentication</h3>
<p>Authentication is required for any API request that you make, whether it's in the API Playground or in your own scripts. We use a simple header-based authentication method, X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE. This is available in your Profile Settings &gt; API Key.</p>
<h3 data-hsprotectlevel=""3"">Step-by-Step Process</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get Permits for a Contractor</strong></p>
<p>Use the <code>/v2/permits/search</code> endpoint to retrieve permits for a specific contractor using the contractor_id parameter. In cases where the required field is a value, like a specific contractor_id or address_id, then it's mandatory to first retrieve the foundational data point before getting the insights for it.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>bash</div>
<div>
<pre><code>curl -X GET \<br>  'https://api.shovels.ai/v2/permits/search?contractor_id=YOUR_CONTRACTOR_ID&amp;permit_from=2022-01-01&amp;permit_to=2024-12-31' \<br>  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 2: Extract Geographic Data</strong></p>
<p>The response includes a wealth of information about each permit including jurisdiction and location details. From each permit record, extract:</p>
<ul data-hsprotectdepth=""0"">
<li data-hsprotectindex=""0"">City/jurisdiction names</li>
<li data-hsprotectindex=""1"">Zip codes</li>
<li data-hsprotectindex=""2"">Any additional geographic identifiers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create Unique Lists</strong></p>
<p>Process the permit data to create deduplicated lists of:</p>
<ul data-hsprotectdepth=""0"">
<li data-hsprotectindex=""0"">All cities where the contractor has worked</li>
<li data-hsprotectindex=""1"">All zip codes in their service area</li>
<li data-hsprotectindex=""2"">Geographic coverage patterns over time</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-hsprotectlevel=""3"">Understanding Permit Data Structure</h3>
<p>The response includes information about each permit including description, number, jurisdiction, property_type, tags, and other relevant data. The current version of the API is v2, which is reflected in the endpoints URL structure: /v2/.</p>
<h3 data-hsprotectlevel=""3"">Geographic Filtering Capabilities</h3>
<p>The new geo_id system enables precise searching by address, zip code, jurisdiction, city, and county - making location-based queries more powerful than ever. With the brand new geo_id schema, we can expand our search capabilities to a broader capacity, now including counties and jurisdictions.</p>
<h3 data-hsprotectlevel=""3"">Best Practices</h3>
<ol data-hsprotectdepth=""0"">
<li data-hsprotectindex=""0""><strong>Use Date Ranges</strong>: Generally speaking, the required fields are the start and end dates for the query, and the corresponding geo_id to point the query to the right place. Query recent permit data (last 2-3 years) for active service areas.</li>
<li data-hsprotectindex=""1""><strong>Handle Pagination</strong>: The API returns data in JSON format, either as pages or single objects. Make sure to handle paginated responses to get complete permit histories.</li>
<li data-hsprotectindex=""2""><strong>Filter by Property Type</strong>: Use property_type parameters to filter by residential or commercial work to understand different service area patterns.</li>
</ol>
<h3 data-hsprotectlevel=""3"">Shovels Online Alternative</h3>
<p>In Shovels Online, we show recent permits for each contractor. You can search for permits and contractors at the county, city, or even specific address level and download permit and contractor data to CSV with a single click.</p>
<h3 data-hsprotectlevel=""3"">Additional Resources</h3>
<p>For more detailed information about using the API, check out the API Reference tab in the documentation hub which outlines all endpoints, parameters, requirements, and responses. You can also use the /list/* endpoints to get the latest valid values for tags and other filters.</p>

Our key sources include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local jurisdiction websites:</strong> We collect data directly from city and county building departments' online permit portals</li>
<li><strong>Municipal open data portals:</strong> Many jurisdictions publish their permit data through dedicated open data initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Building department APIs:</strong> When available, we connect to official jurisdiction APIs to access permit information</li>
<li><strong>Public records requests:</strong> For jurisdictions without digital access, we obtain data through formal records requests</li>
</ul>
<p>We then supplement this permit data with additional information from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State contractor licensing boards:</strong> To verify contractor information and licensing status</li>
<li><strong>Address standardization databases:</strong> We use multiple sources (National Address Dataset from the US Census, Open Address dataset, Simple Maps, and ESRI) to standardize and geocode addresses</li>
<li><strong>Tax assessor records:</strong> To enhance property information associated with permits</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, we cover jurisdictions representing about 80% of the US population, with new jurisdictions being added monthly.</p>

<ul>
<li>APPLICANT_EMAIL from PERMITS table:&nbsp; If there's an email of the applicant, we will include it here. Sometimes it's the homeowner email, sometimes it's a builder or their contractor (depends on who is applying) - this is EDL only, not in the API</li>
<li>OWNER_EMAIL from the PERMITS table: same, this comes from the permit; if it's there, we will include it if someone filled it out (note: if filled, this is the owner email at time of permit submission, so it could have changed depending on how old the permit is) - this is EDL only, not in the API</li>

"Shovels Knowledge Base","How does Shovels Online work?","Shovels Online is a powerful tool to help you find building permits and building contractors anywhere in the USA.","en","https://support.shovels.ai/how-does-shovels-online-work","<h4>Dashboard Search Functionality</h4>
<h3>How does the search function work?</h3>
<p>The Shovels dashboard uses an ""AND"" search logic. This means when you select multiple search criteria, the results will show permits that match ALL selected criteria, not just one or the other.</p>
<h3>Can I search by specific keywords?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can search by description keywords. This is particularly useful when looking for specific brand names (like Tesla), building materials, or equipment types (such as heat pumps).</p>
<p>&lt;aside&gt; Note: The search system currently does not account for typos or variations in terminology. Contractors may use different abbreviations (like ""SFR"" instead of ""single family residence""), so keep this in mind when searching.</p>
<p>&lt;/aside&gt;</p>
<h4>Permit Statuses Explained</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What do the different permit statuses mean?</p>
<p>Permits in the Shovels dashboard can have the following statuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied For:</strong> The permit is in review</li>
<li><strong>Active:</strong> The permit has been approved</li>
<li><strong>Finaled:</strong> The permit is fully completed</li>
<li><strong>Inactive:</strong> No date changes have been observed for this permit in a while</li>
</ul>
<p>For more detailed information on permit statuses, check out the blog post on the Shovels website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Contractor Search</h4>
<h3>How can I find contractors?</h3>
<p>You can search for contractors based on the types of permits they've pulled. The contractor search provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business names</li>
<li>Total lifetime number of permits pulled</li>
<li>Detailed contractor information (for full subscribers)</li>
<li>Contact information</li>
<li>History of permits they've pulled</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;aside&gt; Important: Not all permits include contractor information. Some jurisdictions don't require contractors to provide their contact details.</p>
<p>&lt;/aside&gt;</p>
<h4>Permit Search</h4>
<h3>What information is available about permits?</h3>
<p>When viewing permits, you'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permit status</li>
<li>Address (when available)</li>
<li>Detailed information about the work being done</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some permits may not have addresses. This is common with new construction permits where an address hasn't been assigned yet.</p>
<h4>Data Export Options</h4>
<h3>Can I export the data?</h3>
<p>Paying customers can download search results as CSV files. This feature is not available on trial accounts.</p>
<h4>Additional Resources</h4>
<h3>Where can I learn more about the data available?</h3>
<p>Check out the Data Dictionary on the Shovels website. It provides information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data schema</li>
<li>Permit categories</li>
<li>Contractor information</li>
<li>Additional appended data points</li>

<h2>Understanding Permit Statuses</h2>
<p>In the context of permit tracking, various statuses are used to indicate the progress of a permit. Common statuses include &quot;in_review,&quot; &quot;active,&quot; &quot;final,&quot; and &quot;inactive.&quot; These terms help track a permit's journey from filing to completion or discontinuation.</p>
<h2>Difference Between 'Unknown' and 'None' Permit Status</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> This status typically indicates that there is missing or unreported data regarding the permit. It suggests that the system does not have sufficient information to categorize the permit accurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>None:</strong> This status may also reflect a lack of data, but it is often interpreted as the absence of any applicable permit status. It indicates that no permit has been issued or that the permit status is not applicable in the given context.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both terms are not standard permit statuses found in available documentation, and their exact meanings may vary depending on the context or jurisdiction. For specific cases or further clarification, it may be beneficial to consult a human agent who can provide more detailed assistance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Understanding the distinctions between 'Unknown' and 'None' permit statuses is essential for interpreting permit data accurately. If you encounter these statuses, they generally signify missing or unreported information, and further inquiry may be necessary for clarification.</p>

This data is compiled from multiple sources and validated using consensus and observation methodologies.</p>
<h3>Available Resident Data</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographic Features:</strong> The API provides access to various demographic attributes, including:
<ul>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age range</li>
<li>Income range</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Access Requirements:</strong> To access resident data, common linkages such as name, address, and workplace must be established.</li>
</ul>
<h3>API Endpoints for Resident Data</h3>
<p>While the primary focus of the Shovels API documentation is on permits and contractors, resident demographic data is available through specialized endpoints. The resident data can be accessed via:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specialized Data Endpoints:</strong> These endpoints are part of Shovels' extended data products, including the Universal Schema and Consumer Attributes dataset.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Access Resident Data</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>API Subscription:</strong> To access resident demographic data, you need a Shovels API subscription.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation Review:</strong> For detailed information on the available resident data fields and schema, refer to the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiIxx37_-6vGfGp2i5pXv4w2FdsLsShjCqSVO5v6OMQ/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener"">Data Dictionary</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> You can extract resident data using the appropriate API endpoints as outlined in the documentation. This includes using specific parameters to retrieve the desired datasets.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The API does not provide individual resident data through the basic permit and contractor endpoints. Instead, it focuses on properties and contractors, aligning with how permit data is collected and published by local jurisdictions.</li>
<li>Instead, use the geo_id to access the residents from our residents endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Accessing resident data through the Shovels API is possible with a subscription and by utilizing specialized endpoints. For comprehensive details on the data available and how to retrieve it, users should refer to the Universal Schema documentation. If you have specific use cases or need further assistance, consider reaching out for additional support.</p>","Data","","","1765203938291","PUBLISHED","false"

<h4><strong>Step 1: Get the Address's Geo ID</strong></h4>
<p>Use the <a href=""/api-reference/addresses/search-addresses"">Search Addresses</a> endpoint with your target address. This returns the address's <code>geo_id</code>—a unique identifier you'll need for the next step.</p>
<h4><strong>Step 2: Search Permits Using the Geo ID</strong></h4>
<p>Use the <a href=""/api-reference/permits/search-permits"">Search Permits</a> endpoint with the <code>geo_id</code> from Step 1, along with your desired date range.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The <code>geo_id</code> parameter is a unified geography filter. The same permit search works whether you pass in a state abbreviation (<code>CA</code>), a zip code (<code>94103</code>), or an individual address's <code>geo_id</code>. You're just swapping out the geography level.</p>
<h4><strong>Alternative: Use Shovels Online</strong></h4>
<p>For quick lookups without code, use the <strong>Location Search</strong> feature in <a href=""https://app.shovels.ai"">Shovels Online</a> to search by address directly.</p>

"Shovels Knowledge Base","Permit Status Details","Understanding Shovels Permit Statuses","en","https://support.shovels.ai/permit-status-details","<p>In the context of permit tracking, various statuses are used to indicate the lifecycle and progress of a permit from filing to completion or discontinuation. Common permit statuses include ""in_review,"" ""active,"" ""final,"" and ""inactive."" These statuses help users understand where a permit stands in the overall process. <span style=""background-color: transparent;"">These statuses follow a chronological progression in most cases.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In the Shovels ecosystem, there are&nbsp;<strong>four</strong> statuses that permits can be in:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>in_review</code>: From the moment the permit is filed with the local jurisdiction, until it is approved. This is defined by the&nbsp;<code>file_date</code>&nbsp;object.</li>
<li><code>active</code>: From the moment the permit is approved, until project completion or some other intermediate restriction. This is defined by the&nbsp;<code>issue_date</code>&nbsp;object.</li>
<li><code>final</code>: When the permit is completed, and submitted back to the jurisdiction upon job completion. This is defined by the&nbsp;<code>final_date</code>&nbsp;object.</li>
<li><code>inactive</code>: If any part of the process stalls or gets restricted from progression, then the permit status moves to&nbsp;<code>inactive</code>. Disqualifying reasons and reporting time will vary by jurisdiction and local regulation, but can include failing to meet project inspections, the permit may expire before completion or&nbsp;<a href=""https://ecode360.com/6567722#6567722"">inactivity for more than 6 months (180 days)</a>, and many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes there are ""unknown"" and ""none"" permit statuses. There are various reasons this can happen, including variances in jurisdiction record keeping, lack of data, dates not provided, and more. The exact meanings of these statuses can vary depending on the context or jurisdiction in which they are used.</p>

"Shovels Knowledge Base","Best Practices for Optimizing Responses with the Shovels API","","en","https://support.shovels.ai/-temporary-slug-e90ddefc-d2d6-4931-a269-5d105aede837","<p>To optimize API responses when using the Shovels API, consider the following best practices:</p>
<h2>Key Tips for Optimizing API Responses</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the Address Search API First</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always start with the Address Search API to obtain a valid geo_id. This step ensures that you receive consistent and accurate results, even if the address format varies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handle Errors Properly</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared to manage errors effectively. If you use an invalid geo_id, you will receive a 422 error. If the geo_id is valid but not linked to any property data, a 200 response will be returned with an empty result set. Ensure your application can handle both scenarios.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Utilize Filters Efficiently</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The permit search endpoint allows the use of filters for parameters such as date and permit type. Applying these filters can help narrow down results and reduce the amount of unnecessary data returned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for Empty Result Sets</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treat empty result sets as an indication that the address may not be in the system, rather than solely relying on error codes. This can help in understanding the response better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By following these guidelines, you can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of your API interactions with the Shovels API. Implementing these practices will help ensure smoother operations and better management of API responses.</p>

"Shovels Knowledge Base","How to Request Manual Reports on the Shovels Platform","","en","https://support.shovels.ai/how-to-request-manual-reports-on-the-shovels-platform","Summary
<p>This article explains how to manually run reports within the Shovels platform, including the current capabilities and options available for users.</p>
Manual Report Generation
<p>Currently, users can still request manual reports from the support team while the functionality for generating reports directly from the web app is being improved. If you need a specific report, you can reach out to support and provide details about the format and data you require.</p>
<h3>Steps to Request a Manual Report</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Contact Support</strong>: Reach out to the Shovels support team via email (sales@shovels.ai), <a href=""https://www.shovels.ai/contact"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Contact Us</a> form, or phone.</li>
<li><strong>Specify Your Needs</strong>: Clearly describe the type of report you need, including any specific data points or formats you want.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Examples</strong>: If possible, share an example of the report format you are looking for to help the support team create the report to your specifications.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you need a list of solar permits for a specific company, such as Vivint or Solar City, mention this in your request.</li>
<li>If you require historical data beyond the standard limits available in the dashboard, indicate that you need an ""all-time"" history report.</li>
</ul>
Current Limitations
<ul>
<li>The web app currently allows users to access data only for the last 12 months unless manually adjusted by support.</li>
<li>There may be limits on the number of results that can be exported at one time, so it is advisable to request reports for smaller batches or specific filters.</li>
</ul>
Conclusion
<p>While the ability to manually run reports is still available through support, users are encouraged to specify their needs clearly to ensure they receive the correct data. As the platform continues to evolve, improvements to report generation capabilities are expected in the future.</p>","EDL","","","1768240248966","PUBLISHED","false"
"Shovels Knowledge Base","Troubleshooting a Greyed-Out ""Apply Filters"" Button: Steps to Resolve","","en","https://support.shovels.ai/troubleshooting-a-greyed-out-apply-filters-button-steps-to-resolve","<p>If the ""Apply filters"" button is greyed out, it typically indicates one of two issues related to the filters you have set. Here’s what you can do to resolve the problem:</p>
Possible Reasons for the Greyed-Out Button
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Address/Filter Details Not Resolved</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system requires a valid address or search parameter (such as a geo_id) to enable results. If the address or filters do not match what’s in the database, the button will remain inactive, and no results will appear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Results for Filters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the information entered is correct but there are no permits that match your filters, the system will also return nothing, causing the ""Apply filters"" button to be greyed out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
Steps to Troubleshoot
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Required Fields</strong>: Ensure that all required address fields are filled in accurately. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>geolocation (such as state, county, city, jurisdiction, zip code or address)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify Dates and Geography</strong>: Make sure you have both date fields and a geographical area set. These are typically the first fields you encounter on the top left of the filter options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broaden Your Filters</strong>: If you are still encountering issues, try broadening your filters or double-checking the spelling and format of the information you have entered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you continue to experience difficulties or need assistance with a specific search, consider reaching out for further help.</p>","General","","","1768240330775","PUBLISHED","false"
